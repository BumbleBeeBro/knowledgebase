However, some of the given criteria in simulation assessment methods can be combined and used for the trials’ evaluation checklist. CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives The paper provides a review, but distinguishes possible simulations to be performed:|The paper provides a review, but distinguishes possible simulations to be performed:Medical simulators can be organized:- Part-task trainers- Computer-enhanced mannequins (CEM)- Virtual reality simulators- PACS SimulatorsDescribing simulation training for procedural skills, interpretive and noninterpretive skills, team-based training and crisis management, professionalism and communication skills, as well as hybrid and in situ applications of simulation training. |The article summarizes the simulation methods used in radiology for different purposes. There is no defined question in the article. Choosing the method depends on the goal of the simulation, such as simple task, complex task covering many clinical competencies or simulation for formal assessment.|Part-task trainers, computer-enhanced mannequins (CEM), virtual reality simulators, and PACS simulators.|Review of simulation methods|Main categories for assessing simulation skills: •Psychometric Tools for Interpersonal/Communication Skills•Checklists for procedural skills•Pretests and posttests for knowledge||Assessment Methods:There are three main categories for assessing simulation skills: psychometric tools for interpersonal/communications skills; checklists for procedural skills; and pretests and posttests for knowledge.Psychometric Tools for Interpersonal/Communications SkillsPsychometrics, instruments, or metrics used to conduct assessment are effective for simulations involving interpersonal/communications skills. Behaviorally anchored rating scale involved the assessment of four elements performed by the physician during the simulations including establishing an appropriate environment, engaging the patient, disclosure/apology, and helping the patient achieve an approach to the event. The encounter is videotaped and rated on a 7-point scale: 1 (extremely ineffective) to 7 (extremely effective). This assessment method can give structured insight to the learner on areas of strength and weakness.Another way is the 360-degree evaluation form, which includes a checklist of 10 items (pertaining to important interpersonal/communication skills), which were each rated using a Likert response format. Feedback from the attending physician and the patient was given to the resident after an observed encounter, and a personal quality improvement interview was conducted.The third way is the Kalamazoo Essential Elements Communication Checklist that consists of seven key elements of physician communications: (1) builds relationships, (2) opens the discussion, (3) gathers information, (4) understands patient’s perspective, (5) shares information, (6) reaches agreement, and (7) provides closure.Procedural SkillsChecklist assesses whether critical actions were performed for specific scenarios.Pretests and Posttests for KnowledgeThese checklists included procedure time, fluoroscopy time, amount of contrast used, and lesion coverage.Observational assessment toolProcedure-specific checklists are based on accurate performance of procedural steps and scoring based on error execution. Components of generic global rating scales that can be applied to a wide variety of simulation scenarios and specialties include items such as respect for tissue, efficiency of time and motion, instrument handling, knowledge of instruments, use of assistants, flow of operation, forward planning, and knowledge of specific procedural steps.||Advantages of simulation (based on review) for training: -  Allows trainees to gain experience when mitigating the risk of harm to patients-  Allows for an interchangeable curriculum depending on trainees’ level- Affords the trainees’ multiple opportunities to practice and learn in a less stressful environment-  Acquire skills, which can be translated to improve in both technical/ procedural and diagnostic/interpretive skills.|According to the authors, further work is required to validate some of the assessment tools so that they can be used to document proficiency.||

Research suggests that many preventable adverse events can be attributed to nontechnical error occurring within a ward context. Ward rounds represent the primary point of interaction between patient and physician but take place without formalized training or assessment. The simulated ward should provide an environment in which processes of perioperative care can be performed safely and realistically, allowing multidisciplinary assessment and training of full ward rounds.

A large quantity of research on optimizing the emergency management has been done while still has improvement space. In this paper, a new method called D-DEMATEL which combines D number theory and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) in emergency management is proposed. Firstly, multiple experts evaluate the direct relations of influential factors in emergency management respectively from positive and negative side. The evaluation results are presented as intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). Secondly, convert the IFNs into D numbers and use the combination rule of D numbers to fuse group opinions. Thirdly, based on DEMATEL, the cause-effect classification of factors can be obtained. Finally, the factors in cause category are identified as CSFs in emergency management. Based on the proposed method, the optimization of emergency management can be efficiently simplified into optimizing the identified CSFs.

72|A risk assessment tool for improving safety standards and emergency management in Italian onshore wind farms|Astiaso Garcia, Davide ; Bruschi, Daniele|2016|Wind energy;Onshore wind farms;Occupational health and safety;Emergency response;Safety standards|The renewable energy sector has seen a rapid expansion in recent years and the number of green jobs is quickly increasing. The development of wind sector, associated with a strong focus on innovation, has given importance to the assessment of new and emerging hazards and risks for ensuring adequate, safe and healthy working conditions. The main aim of this paper is to provide a tool for improving proactive safety standards in onshore wind farms. The emergency management was outlined integrating some pinpointed indicators identified by wind turbines owners and manufacturers in a simple and practical instrument (risk assessment tool) aimed to facilitate emergency responses in case of accidents. The idea was to develop a systematic pattern that allows the employers and those responsible for the plant prevention to better manage an emergency event based on a risk assessment in an onshore wind farm during the operation stage. Specifically, the tool was tested and used to classify the risk level for occupational safety in 56 Italian onshore wind farms. The results obtained provide an overview of the crucial factors for optimizing the emergency management process in onshore wind farms at national level.|Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/72-SRL_LL codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/72.pdf|https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213138816300625/pdfft?md5=16e5e862608c7f7fa3270c986f8ecda2&pid=1-s2.0-S2213138816300625-main.pdf|Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments 18(2016): 48-58Davide Astiaso Garcia, Daniele BruschiComments: Following a clear problem definition, authors provide a simple and practical tool based on the expert knowledge. Although the problem was handled locally, the same research can be applied in another region or country as well, because the methodological steps are clear, and the indicators are global. As in Driver+, the trials are set up according to a local issue, however, it is necessary to ensure the applicability of the same methods, globally, in another country. Criteria Description (e.g. quote, description, etc.)  Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives  Overall aim: to provide a simple and practical tool for improving proactive safety standards in onshore wind farms. Objective: to develop a systematic pattern that allows the employers and those responsible for the plant prevention to better manage an emergency event based on a risk assessment in an onshore wind farm during the operation stage. |Overall aim: to provide a simple and practical tool for improving proactive safety standards in onshore wind farms.

76|Project training evaluation: Reshaping boundary objects and assumptions|Lee-Kelley, Liz ; Blackman, Deborah|2012|Training evaluation;Boundary objects;Appraisal;Learning|Training evaluation is an important component of personal development which has received insufficient attention by project managers, members of project teams and their organisations, making training a target for cut-back at times of tightening budgets. Assessing training has historically been operationally oriented, emphasising financial justification, content and quality of the training rather than the potential of improved project performance or organisational transformation. This qualitative, multi-case study demonstrates the limitations of normative boundary objects (the processes, artefacts, documents or technical language or vocabulary in common use within the project community) such as ‘best practise’ models and ‘bodies of knowledge’ as the driver and basis for training. The paper proposes using alternate boundary objects to incorporate reflective practises which can increase the utilisation of learning by embedding it in specific contexts. Study findings are of relevance to project workers by helping them think differently about the purpose and outcome of training attendance, and for managers charged with developing the project and programme talent pool within the organisation.|International Journal of Project Management|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/76-SRL_LL codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/76.pdf|http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786311000329/pdfft?md5=06264b19793a88cfd5365de22aece8c5&pid=1-s2.0-S0263786311000329-main.pdf|International Journal of Project Management 30 (2012) 73-82. Liz Lee-Kelley, Deborah Blackman Comments: As suggested in this article, trials should include performance improvement, although it is hard to assess. Besides, in trials it is necessary to establish a system in which the participants shall share what they learnt. It is also good if experiences can be shared with public or at least with all the participants to let them see other’s experience as well. As indicated by Kelley and Blackman, knowledge development and transformation can be facilitated only where dialogue and interaction enables activities. It is important to focus on not only activities/methods during trials, but also on the needs that emerge after trials to ensure the knowledge development and transformation. The paper demonstrates the limitations of normative boundary objects (the processes, artefacts, etc. in common use within the project community) such as ‘best practice’ models and ‘bodies of knowledge’ as the driver and basis for training.

All the cases are companies which are publicly listed and are of a similar capitalisation, workforce size and using projects as a means of achieving their contracts and in-house initiatives. Companies 1 and 4 are manufacturing organisations using projects for non-process activities and inhouse improvement initiatives. Companies 2 and 3 are projectbased service organisations. Company 2 and Company 4 are nationally acclaimed learning organisations (LO). Learning is strongly encouraged and employee learning is fed back into the organisation as increased innovative capabilities.|The subject of the research and its epistemological underpinning align it with a qualitative approach as the focus is exploration and development of new insights.A comparative case study methodology was adopted in order to undertake an in-depth investigation into a specific set of circumstances in a particular context. These were instrumental and exploratory case studies, in that their purpose was to provide insights into an issue that will enable a deeper understanding of the role of boundary objects for identifying project training needs and subsequent evaluation of their outcome effects.|How did participants find the learning experience? Did the intervention provide the learning the participants expected?Did participants change their behaviour because of the training or intervention? Was the training aligned with the strategic development aims of the organisation and did it deliver the intended learning outcomes?•Appraisal•Levels of learning•Targeting and rewarding of knowledge development|Three sets of data from documentary reviews, open ended questionnaires and semistructured interviews were drawn from the cases. Samples of organisational literature and documentation were analysed to understand the organisational views of their own learning and knowledge development practises. Written definitions of professional development, learning, knowledge and the differentforms of processes and their implementation were also examined.|Comparison of data coming from case studies with current theory and the ability to create novel ideas and new theory from the data itself.Next, open-ended questionnaires explored differences in perceptions pertaining to knowledge, learning, culture, and the nature of organisations, and the role of information for project communication and coordination. For each word, (knowledge, learning, data, information, culture, organization etc.) respondents were asked to give their definition and then use the word in a sentence demonstrating their interpretation.||All four participating organisations operated a formal performance appraisal system that led to the output of a training and development schedule for their employees.The findings suggest an organisational mind-set that pre-empted new learning by developing boundary objects that were too specific not suitable for complex issues.Close examination of the types of boundary objects in use revealed that the boundary repositories, forms, objects and models were similar across the four companies. Participants acknowledged the importance of keeping well informed in terms of the latest tools and techniques and the need to learn from project lessons but could not provide insight into the mechanisms for assessing learning and application in subsequent projects.There was no specified methodology to evaluate their impact on team cohesion, project delivery and outcomes. Instead, cost driver meant that ‘value-for-money’ related to how cheaply could the organisation procure and offer their employees project training.The levels of learning were analysed across all four companies and, despite the LOs' expressed focus on clear objectives and personal development pathways, the levels of learning being demonstrated were similar.Training interventions appear to be successful but references to gaining information via training and education did not include sharing or developing others either from a lack of means or motivation. Participants were aware of what went wrong in their projects and knew how to fix problems generally, but did not always consider the Know Why. Knowing what and how without addressing the underlying causes can lock project members into a crisis-management cycle.How knowledge can ‘transfer to the job’ remains unknown.|Training interventions appear to be successful but references to gaining information via training and education did not include sharing or developing others either from a lack of means or motivation.Performance improvement was hard to assess.Greater attention should be paid to the front-end of training, not just computing the economic value or benefit of training, but ensuring true value-added by developing a shared understanding and identification with the organisational goals and working out a strategy to manage their achievement through appropriate boundary objects (e.g. benefits realisation maps and balanced scorecards).||

Although these exercises are widely performed, no standardized method exists for their evaluation. Study Objectives: To describe a simple and objective method to assess medical performance during functional exercise events. Methods: An evaluation tool comprising three data fields (triage, clinical maneuvers, and radio usage), accompanied by direct anecdotal observational methods, was used to evaluate a large functional mass casualty incident exercise. Results: Seventeen medical responders managed 112 victims of a simulated building explosion. Although 81% of the patients were assigned the appropriate triage codes, evacuation from the site did not follow in priority. Required maneuvers were performed correctly in 85.2% of airway maneuvers and 78.7% of breathing maneuvers, however, significant under-treatment occurred, possibly due to equipment shortages. Extensive use of radio communication was documented. In evaluating this tool, the structured markers were informative, but further information provided by direct observation was invaluable. Conclusion: A three-part tool (triage, medical maneuvers, and radio usage) can provide a method to evaluate functional mass casualty incident exercises, and is easily implemented. For the best results, it should be used in conjunction with direct observation.

Comments: The difference from the DRIVER+ approach is “observers” (evaluators) have been involved during the preparation of the exercise as well. This could be a good approach for Driver+ trials as well. By enabling evaluation of the effectiveness of the response, strengths, and weaknesses of disaster response can be detailed and, consequently, the level of preparedness for real events can be raised.

The victims were prepared for the exercise by donning appropriate attire and make-up. The students were given detailed instructions in a separate course regarding their roles as victims. Each student was given a set of dynamic casualty cards that were inserted in a transparent envelope and safely attached to a lanyard to be worn around the mock victim’s neck. Setting: A conventional explosive blast in a two-story building was simulated in Casalvolone, Italy. Patient distribution within the building by Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment. Student medical responders were assigned roles within the exercise that were commensurate with their previous experience.During the exercise, the local fire brigade, emergency medical services (EMS), police, and civil protection acted in their usual capacities. However, none of these agencies had been previously informed of the scenario.Triage: Before the exercise, patients were assigned ideal triage scores according to the START criteria.Treatment maneuvers. In the clinical scenario, patients received mandatory maneuvers of four different subtypes, performed by the medical responders, which would be necessary parts of patient treatment.Radio usage: Two radio channels were available for participant usage. The first channel was used for medical coordination and connected the on-site medical officer with the dispatch center, first responder, secondary triage officer, command post medical officer, and fire brigade.

Three observers were physicians with experience in disaster management and four were medical students with a special interest in disaster medicine. The observers had participated in the organization of the exercise and design of the evaluation forms.All radio traffic was digitally recorded, with each communication being time-stamped.Anecdotal observations: Digital photographs and video recordings were used extensively to document the progress of the exercise.|Radio Records’ Analysis: During the post-exercise analysis, communications were sorted into eight categories: asking for support, answering a request, reporting position, requesting assistance, commanding, waiting for instructions, giving information, and other. A diagram of points and lines representing relations among rescuers to display position of power and lines of communication was plotted.Anecdotal observations. These images were integrated into the CITE Explorer® software package (VLS System AB, Linkoping, Sweden), which allowed a time-synchronized discrete event representation of rescue operations.Statistical Analysis: Contingency table tests were used to compare the mean triage classes. Non-parametric were used to compare the triage delay, evacuation time from crash area, and collecting area between triage categories. The appropriateness of the triage and the evacuation priorities were evaluated to reveal any significant statistical differences between planned and assigned triage color code and delay time. Treatment means were also analyzed statistically to point out different levels of efficiency. The further division of incorrect maneuvers into categories of overtreatment and under-treatment, and their comparison, was viewed as an index of available resources in a particular situation.||Seventeen medical responders managed 112 victims of a simulated building explosion. Although 81% of the patients were assigned the appropriate triage codes, evacuation from the site did not follow in priority.

Extensive use of radio communication was documented. In evaluating this tool, the structured markers were informative, but further information provided by direct observation was invaluable.Data communication played a pivotal role in disaster and MCI response. An accurate and objective method for evaluation of exercises would allow the determination of strengths and weaknesses in the disaster response; and ultimately provides the data needed for improvement of the response system. |Although much attention was given to making the scenario as realistic as possible, the scenario was still a simulation.The degree to which human performance during the simulation mimics behavior in a true disaster is unknown. The present evaluation system is also limited to markers of individual human performance, and does not evaluate equipment, information systems, or even patient management protocols.A three-part tool (triage, medical maneuvers, and radio usage) can provide a method to evaluate functional mass casualty incident exercises, and is easily implemented.

The tool is observational, and thus non-intrusive in its useb. The tool consists of a relatively small number of itemsc. The tool consists of observable behaviours (i.e., the amount of inference involved from the part of the rater/trainer is minimised) Feasibility was evaluated qualitatively: did the trainer OR nurse of our study find the tool usable?Reliability: ICATS-N_ should capture OR nurses’ technical skills consistently.The tool consists of observable behaviours (i.e., the amount of inference involved from the part of the rater/trainer is minimised) Reliability was evaluated quantitatively in the form of internal consistency (Cronbach a coefficients)Validity: ICATS-N_ should capture what it purports to capture (i.e., OR nurses’ technical skills). Face validity was evaluated qualitatively, via expert opinion in the development of the tool. Content validity was evaluated (i) qualitatively, via expert opinion in the development of the tool and (ii) quantitatively, via correlational analyses of core skills as defined in ICATS-N.|Through the control room, one of two trainer nurses (JH, ES) rated trainees’ technical skill using ICATS-N. (For practical reasons (ongoing clinical commitment), it was not possible to have both trainers rating the trainees simultaneously, which precludes any analysis of interrater reliability.) On completion of the procedure, trainees also completed ICATS-N to rate their own performance and received feedback on their performance from the trainer.|All data analyses were carried out using SPSS v. 14.0. Reliability, in the form of internal consistency, was assessed via Cronbach a coefficients (and we also report the lowest item–total correlation obtained for each item). Cronbach a values range between 0 and 1 with values >0.70 typically considered adequate in research contexts. Content validity was assessed via Spearman r correlation coefficients between different core skills as rated by the trainer nurse. Non-parametric coefficients were computed due to small sample size. Medium-sized correlations between skills will provide evidence for adequate content validity. Correlations between trainer and trainees’ ratings across skills were reported as well.|Ethical approval was obtained for the study and informed consent provided by all participants.|The tool was feasible to use in the context of simulation-based training. Satisfactory reliability (Cronbach a) was obtained across trainers’ and trainees’ scores (analyzed jointly and separately).

The present evidence suggests that the ICATS-N_ could be considered for use as an assessment/training tool for junior OR nurses.In future empirical work, it is essential to replicate the present findings with larger samples that should ideally be drawn from different institutions.||
98|A service oriented architecture for decision support systems in environmental crisis management|Vescoukis, Vassilios ; Doulamis, Nikolaos ; Karagiorgou, Sofia|2012|Environmental modeling;Computer applications;Service oriented architectures;Decision support;Crisis management|Efficient management of natural disasters impose great research challenges to the current environmental crisis management systems in terms of both architecture and services. This is mainly due to the fact that a large amount of geospatial content is usually distributed, non-compliant to standards, and needs to be transmitted under a QoS guaranteed framework to support effective decision making either in case of an emergency or in advance planning. Incorporating real time capabilities in Web services, both in terms of dynamic configuration and service selection, is an open research agenda. The things get worst in geospatial context due to the huge amount of data transmitted from distributed sensors under heterogeneous platforms, making the need of synchronization an important issue. In this paper, we propose a flexible service oriented architecture for planning and decision support in environmental crisis management. The suggested architecture uses real time geospatial data sets and 3D presentation tools, integrated with added-value services, such as simulation models for assisting decision making in case of emergency. The proposed architectural framework goes beyond integration and presentation of static spatial data, to include real time middleware that is responsible for selecting the most appropriate method of the available geospatial content and service in order to satisfy the QoS requirements of users and/or application. A case study of a complete, real world implementation of the suggested framework dealing with forest fire crisis management system is also presented.|Future Generation Computer Systems|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/98-SRL_LL codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/98.pdf|http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X11000380/pdfft?md5=35526f316eeb624d8ed098e66e281d16&pid=1-s2.0-S0167739X11000380-main.pdf|Future Generation Computer Systems 28 (2012) 593-604Vassilios Vescoukis, Nikolaos Doulamis, Sofia KaragiorgouComments: Real time geospatial data is presented through 3D presentation tools.

Network monitoring allows implementation of network control mechanisms through media transport protocols (i.e., TCP/IP, UDP or DCCP) able to automatically adapt media delivered streams to the current network capabilities maximizing, however, users’/service QoS requirements as much as possible.Two different types of geospatial data are supported: the archival and the real time data.The real time requirements are described using the WS-resource framework.Real time and archival data are published to the Real Time Middleware using a Web Service interface.The Real Time Middleware incorporates advanced data filtering methods for reducing the transmitted information. It is also responsible for preprocessing the spatial data in order to best support the required 3D visualization performance and to provide the pre-processed data layers required by the added-value services middleware layer.Data filtering is accomplished in the temporal, spatial and quality data direction.The Real Time Middleware incorporates methods that enable service interaction with the network layer of the OSI architecture. This interaction allows for a real time service streaming of the data.The presentation layer is responsible for transforming the received geospatial data in a format suitable for Web browser interface.|Two different types of data are supported: the archival and the real time data. The archival data stored in spatial and distributed databases, while the real time data comes from sensors. Both data are encoding using the OGC specifications and particularly the Geography Markup Language (GML).Regarding processing, storage and communication aspects, time, space and quality filtering methods are required to be considered in an environmental crisis management architecture. Time filtering can be implemented using algorithms that remove the temporal data redundancy (through, for example, data dropping mechanisms), while spatial filtering aims at reducing the spatial one (e.g., spatial data down-sampling). Quality filtering automatically re-quantizes the geospatial content to reduce the transmitted information. All these types of filtering are framed with context awareness mechanisms, which proportionally activates one or all of the above three filtering tools according to the type of disaster and environmental conditions.Presentation of data: Apart from a web based user interface, the future environmental information management systems will incorporate (i) 3D rendering and presentation methods (ii) geospatial presentation and (iii) context aware adaptive visualization tools. 3D presentation and real time rendering allows for a better visualization of the natural disaster and therefore yields a more efficient environmental management. Geospatial presentation includes tools for depicted media overlays of geographic enhancements. Finally, context adaptive methods increase the system efficiency, since it permits a differentiated presentation according to either the capabilities of the terminal devices (e.g., PC or PDA) or the requirements of the application scenario.|Not indicated |It was proposed a QoS-aware service oriented architecture suitable for geospatial information management systems targeted in planning and crisis management. The proposed architecture supports QoS guarantees for delivering geospatial information, which is a very important aspect for decision making and addressing a case of emergency. Furthermore, the proposed architecture exploits added-value service components to go further from simply presenting spatial data, and include services such as environmental simulation models and logistics. Finally, presentation aspects are discussed that enable efficient vector based image representation of GML compatible geospatial contentUsing these specifications, one can create geospatial service oriented architectures, which retain the main principles of web services using, however, different data description languages able to handle geospatial properties, which are a key element in environmental information management systems.|First, although standards do exist, real world spatial data is usually not compliant, nor is it offered through open network interfaces. Second, QoS requirements that are of critical importance to this application domain either cannot be implemented, or, even worse, are rarely a consideration. Third, added-value services such as operational logistics and environmental modeling remain isolated to their originating scientific communities, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics and Operational Research, and only lately begin to be considered as services that can be integrated in such systems.||

131|Expanding the use of simulation in open vascular surgical training|Pandey, Vikas A. ; Wolfe, John H.N.|2012|0|Simulation technology has a well-defined role in nonmedical professions such as aviation and over the last two decades has permeated medical training. The most successful surgical simulation is in the fields of laparoscopic and endovascular surgery. These two-dimensional scenarios, as in the aviation industry, lend themselves to simulation. Open simulators have been met with more resistance than their laparoscopic counterparts because of the difficulties in simulating the three-dimensional field. Engaging in persistent practice is what makes the expert and all trainees should aspire to this. Without knowing, all surgical trainees have engaged in deliberate practice when first learning to tie surgical knots. This deliberate practice should be used in all aspects of vascular surgical practice, and it is no longer acceptable to perform procedures such as arterial anastomoses for the first time on patients. Simulators exist for all aspects of vascular surgical training and vary in complexity and price. Some of these simulators are suitable for use at home or in a skills laboratory whereas others are more suitable for use in a specialized skills center. Training on these simulators can be offered at a local level or at a regional level in the skills center. Where surgical procedures are not commonly performed or expertise is required for a new innovation, it is more appropriate to have national or internationally based workshops under the auspices of surgical boards or societies. Simulation of crisis management, well known in aviation, has also been applied to vascular surgical practice and can offer benefit to senior trainees even when their performance on a noncrisis simulator has reached a plateau. This article identifies the areas where simulation in open vascular surgery can benefit the trainee.|Journal of Vascular Surgery|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_LL codebook-131.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/131.pdf|http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521412008750/pdfft?md5=4e32a4cf260e282af78dfca24d8cf1c6&pid=1-s2.0-S0741521412008750-main.pdf|Pandey, Vikas A. ; Wolfe, John H.N.Comments: not a best practice study on methodology / not about crisis management in general / very specific about the use of models on open vascular surgery also in crisis management situations / not detailed about methodology.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives The objective is to assess performance improvement by use of patient models to simulate open vascular procedures as training innovation.|The objective is to assess performance improvement by use of patient models to simulate open vascular procedures as training innovation.

Transportation related disaster response activities typically include search and rescue, emergency medical care and fire-fighting trips. In this paper, the emergency transportation network design problem is proposed to determine the optimal network to perform emergency response trips with high priority in the aftermath of earthquakes. The problem has three objective functions designated to identify the optimal routes for emergency vehicles considering the length, the travel time and the number of paths as performance metrics of network vulnerability. A combined approach for considering the three objectives including weighted sum and lexicographic methods is used. The proposed model is solved using a branch-and-cut solution method. The suggested method is tested on the well-known Sioux-Falls network as well as on the real-world network of Tehran metropolis, Iran.

In order to effectively achieve this training goal, it is crucial to reliably express fire dynamics as realistic graphics. In the field of engineering, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is widely used to precisely predict the behaviors of fluid phenomena. The resultant data, however, have structures and capacities that are not readily applied to real-time virtual reality systems. This study proposes a series of data conversion techniques and a real-time processing framework to develop a fire training simulator on the basis of a precise CFD simulation that is capable of calculating various invisible physical quantities such as toxic gases and heat as well as visible factors such as smoke and flame. By exploiting safety level-based visualization mapping, this study also proposes a new method to intuitively experience dangerous fire environments and perform training and evaluation.

This paper develops a model for prepositioning supplies in such a setting. Our model has a distinguishing feature the possible destruction of supply points during the disaster event. To gain insight into our model, we develop a series of theoretical properties. To test the applicability of our model a series of computational tests are performed. From such tests we conclude that it is possible to solve relatively large instances of the problem utilizing standard optimization software. A methodology based on creation of clusters of demand points is proposed for solving even larger problems. Finally we study sensitivity of the results with respect to key parameters.

164|Decision support system for emergency management: Road tunnels|Alvear, Daniel ; Abreu, Orlando ; Cuesta, Arturo ; Alonso, Virginia|2013|Decision support system;Emergency management;Road tunnels;Real-time|Recent disasters have shown that road tunnels are especially complex environments for decision making. A fast and effective response to emergencies in road tunnels is a key factor for life safety. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) for emergency management in road tunnels. Based on a specific methodology, the system provides the operator with decision recommendations to deal with the emergency in real time. Furthermore, the system uses predictive tools to estimate the severity of the accident or incident, as well as rescue and evacuation times. This information is very useful during the first stages of an emergency when information is scarce, incomplete and inaccurate, yet the tunnel operator is required to make the right decisions under a high level of stress.

To address time-sensitivity, the routing problem is modeled with the objective of minimizing the sum of arrival times to beneficiaries. We propose a continuous approximation approach which uses aggregated instance data to develop routing policies and cost approximations. Numerical tests are performed that demonstrate the effectiveness of the cost approximations at predicting the true implementation costs of the policies and compare the policies against more complex solution approaches. The continuous approximation approach yields solutions which can be easily implemented; further, this approach reduces the need for detailed data and the computational requirements to solve the problem.|Transportation Research Part B: Methodological|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_LL codebook-173.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/173.pdf|http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261513000167/pdfft?md5=cd9f7e12d69d4ee01872224ff1f6b989&pid=1-s2.0-S0191261513000167-main.pdf|Huang, Michael ; Smilowitz, Karen R. ; Balcik, BurcuComments: About vehicle routing problem after a disaster with incomplete information.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives we focus on the assessment routing problem which routes teams to different communities to assess damage and relief needs following a disasterResearch questions |we focus on the assessment routing problem which routes teams to different communities to assess damage and relief needs following a disaster|In this study, we study the assessment routing problem (ARP), which focuses on routing of assessment teams in the disaster area.

The proposed BDI agent framework allows modeling of human behavior with a high degree of fidelity. The realistic attributes that govern the BDI characteristics of the agent are reverse-engineered by conducting human-in-the-loop experiments in the VR-based Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). To enhance generality and interoperability of the proposed crowd simulation modeling scheme, input data models have been developed to define environment attributes (e.g., maps, demographics, evacuation management parameters). The validity of the proposed data models are tested with two different evacuation scenarios. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effect of various crowd evacuation management parameters on the key performance indicators in the evacuation scenario such as crowd evacuation rate and densities. The results reveal that constructed simulation can be used as an effective emergency management tool.|Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_LL codebook-234.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/234.pdf|http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1220000/1218216/p545-shendarkar.pdf?ip=128.176.12.146&id=1218216&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=2BA2C432AB83DA15%2E6FAF9164165DC779%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&CFID=825395978&CFTOKEN=74810203&__acm__=1509714865_d6deeaa5aed5a81b0c7742ba33b24000|Shendarkar, Ameya ; Vasudevan, Karthik ; Lee, Seungho ; Son, Young-JunDeveloping an accurate simulation model to allow responsible agencies to evaluate different evacuation and damage control policies beforehand, which will allow the execution of the most effective crowd evacuation scheme during the actual terror scenario.

236|A nature-inspired decentralized trust model to reduce information unreliability in complex disaster relief operations|Kostoulas, Dionysios ; Aldunate, Roberto ; Pena Mora, Feniosky ; Lakhera, Sanyogita|2008|Extreme events;Information trustworthiness;Natural analogies|One of the foremost challenges confronting society today is the vulnerability of critical physical infrastructures in urban areas to extreme events. The major challenge in these scenarios despite the availability of the means of communication (e.g. ad-hoc networks, hand held devices) is the lack of trust among the first responders due to their having no prior experience of interactions amongst themselves. Also the spreading of inaccurate or misleading information can have disastrous consequences in the chaotic and hazardous environments which are prevalent in large-scale disasters. Therefore it is imperative that the responders possess the ability to assess and evaluate the trustworthiness as well as the information propagated by fellow responders in order to facilitate collaboration. This paper presents a decentralized trust model to enhance reliable information dissemination in large-scale disasters. The model proposed includes a distributed recommendation scheme, incorporated into an existing membership maintenance service for ad-hoc networks. In addition it has a nature-inspired activation spreading mechanism that allows trust-based information propagation. Search and Rescue exercises involving civil engineers and firefighters were conducted at the Illinois Fire Service Institute (IFSI) to test the software. The upshot of the simulation was immediate and robust establishment of trust and high resilience to the spread of the unreliable information.|Advanced Engineering Informatics|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_236 codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/236.pdf|https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1474034607000560/1-s2.0-S1474034607000560-main.pdf?_tid=43cdbee8-c098-11e7-be96-00000aacb360&acdnat=1509714766_be7d340eec0303f85653bba22a9c1806|Dionysios Kostoulas, Roberto Aldunate, Feniosky Pena Mora, Sanyogita LakheraComments: little useful for DRIVER, not enough information about the validation methods, but interesting model to enhance reliable information dissemination in large-scale disastersCriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives A decentralized trust model to enhance reliable information dissemination in large-scale disasters; trust model based on a communication model, distributed recommendation scheme to allow the assessment of trustworthiness in diverse groups of first respondersResearch questions |A decentralized trust model to enhance reliable information dissemination in large-scale disasters;  trust model based on a communication model, distributed recommendation scheme to allow the assessment of trustworthiness in diverse groups of first responders|1. evaluate the performance of the trust system as well as effectiveness,efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach2. support a real rescue exercise|1. software simulation2. a model was implemented as part of the Mobile Ad-Hoc Space for Collaboration (MASC) application which runs on hand held devices enabled with short-range wireless communication|1. comparison of the ant-based techniques with the new model2.

255|Group value and intention to use Ã¢â‚¬â€ A study of multi-agency disaster management information systems for public safety|Lee, JinKyu ; Bharosa, Nitesh ; Yang, Jing ; Janssen, Marijn ; Rao, H.R.|2011|Disaster management;Public sector;Information systems success;Intention to use;Group value;User satisfaction;Task support|This paper examines and extends the theory of information systems success in the context of large-scale disaster management (DM) for public safety. In the recent past, various evaluation reports on DM efforts have concluded that information quality and system quality are major hurdles for efficient and effective multi-agency DM and are critical antecedents for information systems (IS) success. In contrast to the wealth of literature on IS success in profit-oriented business environments, research regarding drivers of public sector IS success is scarce. This research develops and empirically tests a model that explains IS usage intention as a reflective measure of IS success in the public sector DM domain. In this paper, the effects of the expected value of IS for the entire group of collaborating DM agencies, task support, user satisfaction, and three specific information/service quality dimensions on usage intention are examined. Data was collected from emergency responders using a questionnaire survey method during multi-agency, cross-national DM exercises at the DutchÃ¢â‚¬â€œGerman border. The results of the data analysis revealed that expected group value is a key determinant of intention to use in the public sector DM domain. The data analysis also showed that perceived task support only has an indirect effect, through user satisfaction, on the usage intention. These findings imply that previously suggested IS success models for business environments are likely to fall short in their explanatory power and applicability for highly volatile complex disaster environments that require immediate coordinated responses from a large number of organizations. Possible directions for future research are also discussed along with other findings and implications.|Decision Support Systems|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_255 codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/255.pdf|https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0167923610001776/1-s2.0-S0167923610001776-main.pdf?_tid=4ec26da8-c098-11e7-82f2-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1509714785_98f34b4ecadc7e543860683fa7405a6f|JinKyu Lee, Nitesh Bharosa, Jing Yang, Marijn Janssen, H.R.

273|A general computational recognition primed decision model with multi-agent rescue simulation benchmark|Nowroozi, Alireza ; Shiri, Mohammad E. ; Aslanian, Angeh ; Lucas, Caro|2012|Naturalistic decision making;Recognition primed decision model;Computational modeling;Disaster management;RoboCup;Multi-agent rescue simulation benchmark|Analytical decision making strategies rely on weighing pros and cons of multiple options in an unbounded rationality manner. Contrary to these strategies, recognition primed decision (RPD) model which is a primary naturalistic decision making (NDM) approach assumes that experienced and professional decision makers when encounter problems in real operating conditions are able to use their previous experiences and trainings in order to diagnose the problem, recall the appropriate solution, evaluate it mentally, and implement it to handle the problem in a satisficing manner. In this paper, a computational form of RPD, now called C-RPD, is presented. Unified Modeling Language was used as a modeling language to represent the proposed C-RPD model in order to make the implementation easy and obvious. To execute the model, RoboCup Rescue agent simulation environment, which is one of the best and the most famous complex and multi-agent large-scale environments, was selected. The environment simulates the incidence of fire and earthquakes in urban areas where it is the duty of the police forces, firefighters and ambulance teams to control the crisis.

Actors from different fields have to cooperate in dynamic and complex environments and still in an efficient manner. In order to perform, the shared situation awareness of the response organization needs to be as good as possible. The purpose of our research was to identify the factors that affect the formation of shared situation awareness in search and rescue operations. The research is based on the theories of information, communication, and trust. The data collection was performed during a search and rescue exercise held in Finland in 2009 and included both observation and questionnaires. As a result we have defined the critical information needs for cooperation, a method for describing the communication, and the components of system trust.

The response rate was only 25% and the responses were not as specific as we expected. This led to an extra comment round for subject matter experts. The definition of the critical information elements was especially challenging for the human agents. One reason might be that part of the SA is based on tacit knowledge and thus difficult to specify, even though actors knew what they need. Other reason can be that the information sharing processes are not fully established. By specifying the critical information needs, we know what information elements need to be shared in minimum to perform the core tasks.The method of observing different types of communication andmodeling of the social contexts approved to be useful. It enablesthe observation and graphical presentation of how actors communicate. It can also be used to improve communication processes to better support the SSA. A limitation in the method is that communication is modeled as static social contexts. Therefore, the communication is modeled as it occurs at a particular moment in the situation, even though the situation changes during the operation.Another limitation is that the activity level of the communicationprocesses is not shown in the social context model. Therefore, allsocial contexts seem to be equally important in the graphical model,which may cause misunderstandings.The observation method that was used in this study is not sufficient to obtain a comprehensive and quantitative understanding about the level of trust in the cooperation. Therefore, it could be useful if human agents could themselves first evaluate the level of trust in each of those components. This evaluation could be done formally in the next SAR exercise.||

But their use has been extended to other applications such as real-time mode. In this paper we present EvacTunnelÃ‚Â® a real-time model integrated in a Decision Support System (DSS) for emergency management in road tunnel. The proposed model is based on the idea that, in some scenarios such as road tunnels, egress calculations can be performed by addressing a small set of random parameters that have a great impact on outcomes. These parameters are identified as pre-movement times (recognition and response time), travel distances and unimpeded walking speeds. Based on Monte Carlo methods, the model has the capability to perform multiple simulations by changing random variables. As a first stage of verification process, the proposed model is compared with other validated evacuation models. The results are essentially coincident in all models. Based on this analysis it can be argued that the model provides consistent and reasonable results. But the main difference is that the proposed model can provide results faster than real-time (less than 5 s) while the run time of the other models is really higher.|Safety Science|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_292 codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/292.pdf|https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0925753512000628/1-s2.0-S0925753512000628-main.pdf?_tid=a3c27118-c098-11e7-837c-00000aacb35e&acdnat=1509714927_9b3ff50b348553eb370c7ceb649b7cb5|Jorge A.

Therefore, collaborative allocation of emergency material involving multi-organizations becomes one of the key content of emergency management. The collaborative allocation system of emergency material has the characteristics of complex system. Based on synergetic theory of systems engineering and the actual problem of low efficiency of collaborative allocation of emergency material in our country, the key factors influencing efficiency improvement are analyzed in respect of people, organization, material, information, technology and strategy. By adopting and improving QSIM (qualitative simulation method), the inner action mechanism is studied and the conclusion is that the responsibility and authority definition, the coordination ability of decision-makers and information transmission efficiency are the most important factors for the efficiency of collaborative allocation. The measures set forth in this paper are for the reference of relevant decision-makers and we hope it can be helpful for their decision making.|Systems Engineering Procedia|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_339 codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/339.pdf|https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2211381912000811/1-s2.0-S2211381912000811-main.pdf?_tid=b2fe45a8-c098-11e7-8a8a-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1509714952_77b8ad3a9a83a0cf351dcd39429b738c|Liangtan Dou, Ying Sun, Lian SheComments: CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives analyze the relevant factors influencing the efficiency of collaborative allocation of emergency material and improve the key factorsResearch questions |analyze the relevant factors influencing the efficiency of collaborative allocation of emergency material and improve the key factors|analyze the relevant factors influencing the efficiency of collaborative allocation of emergency material and improve the key factors|qualitative simulation technology-QSIM algorithm|Theoretical simulation|•the efficiency of collaborative allocation|No real data used, but simulation with element values between -1 to 2. |qualitative simulation technology-QSIM algorithm||the factors influencing the efficiency of collaborative allocation aredivided into four categories|•“It’s quite difficult to describe the development of most parameters quantitatively.

The lack of proper quantitative measures to assess alternative solutions and guide an iterative development makes this design even harder. The aim of this work is to efficiently find and describe communication patterns that should be avoided in these systems and identify the agents involved in these patterns. For this purpose, this research presents a suite of novel metrics and classification rules that, respectively, measure agentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ communication and classify their results to describe patterns. This work also provides tools for automatically measuring the metrics and applying the classification rules. In order to evaluate this work, the results of applying these metrics and classification rules have been compared with the quality attribute of performance in several MAS. Performance is measured as the time between a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s request and the MAS response, and partially represents the factor of the quality of service. The experiments gather four agent-oriented communication designs that belong to two different domains: Crisis-management and Cinema ticket selling. The study reveals that the detected communication patterns are related with performance, and that the proposed metrics can arguably guide the design of communications improving the overall performance of systems.|Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_371 codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/371.pdf|https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0952197610001697/1-s2.0-S0952197610001697-main.pdf?_tid=d17f2236-c098-11e7-b5b2-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1509715004_e3089e2515a95fa0799872ab77647b3d|Gutiérrez Celia, García-Magariño Iván, Fuentes-Fernández RubénComments: A lack of proper quantitative measures to assess communication design (its iterative process and derived solutions) was identified.

393|Scenario-based design: A method for connecting information system design with public health operations and emergency management|Reeder, Blaine ; Turner, Anne M.|2011|Information needs;Scenario-based design;Public health;Continuity of operations planning;Emergency preparedness|Responding to public health emergencies requires rapid and accurate assessment of workforce availability under adverse and changing circumstances. However, public health information systems to support resource management during both routine and emergency operations are currently lacking. We applied scenario-based design as an approach to engage public health practitioners in the creation and validation of an information design to support routine and emergency public health activities. Methods: Using semi-structured interviews we identified the information needs and activities of senior public health managers of a large municipal health department during routine and emergency operations. Results: Interview analysis identified 25 information needs for public health operations management. The identified information needs were used in conjunction with scenario-based design to create 25 scenarios of use and a public health manager persona.

The emergency management of the Networked Safe Service System thus becomes a very complex problem.

The general idea is to view response management as a process and control problem, then to apply system engineering technology into the emergency response situation. Particularly, a framework to integrate various decision bodies is developed.

Most of them are unconventional contingency events. Emergency relief is an important activity dealing with the disasters to transfer a large number of materials to the destroyed places for casualties and reconstruction for the country, even the world. Container multimodal transportation will play an important role because of its superior characteristics. The relations in the process of supply and transportation build up the container supply chain. It is critical to schedule the multimodal transportation flow of the chain with time efficiency of higher reliability. In this study, the system of container multimodal transportation emergency relief is modeled as an affinity network inspired by the immune system. An integer linear programming model is proposed to build the path selection for container supply chain in the context of emergency relief. The simulation study shows the promising effects of the model.

500|Simulation for team training and assessment: case studies of online training with virtual worlds|Heinrichs, WLR ; Youngblood, P ; surgery, PM HarterÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã‚Â - World journal of|2008|0|Individuals in clinical training programs concerned with critical medical care must learn to manage clinical cases effectively as a member of a team. However, practice on live patients is often unpredictable and frequently repetitive. The widely substituted alternative for real patients—high-fidelity, manikin-based simulators (human patient simulator)—are expensive and require trainees to be in the same place at the same time, whereas online computer-based simulations, or virtual worlds, allow simultaneous participation from different locations. Here we present three virtual world studies for team training and assessment in acute-care medicine: (1) training emergency department (ED) teams to manage individual trauma cases; (2) prehospital and in-hospital disaster preparedness training; (3) training ED and hospital staff to manage mass casualties after chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive incidents. The research team created realistic virtual victims of trauma (6 cases), nerve toxin exposure (10 cases), and blast trauma (10 cases); the latter two groups were supported by rules-based, pathophysiologic models of asphyxia and hypovolemia. Evaluation of these virtual world simulation exercises shows that trainees find them to be adequately realistic to ‘‘suspend disbelief,’’ and they quickly learn to use Internet voice communication and user interface to navigate their online character/avatar to work effectively in a critical care team. Our findings demonstrate that these virtual ED environments fulfill their promise of providing repeated practice opportunities in dispersed locations with uncommon, life-threatening trauma cases in a safe, reproducible, flexible setting.|Springer|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_500 codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/500.pdf|https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00268-007-9354-2.pdf|Heinrichs LeRoy William, Youngblood Patricia, Harter Phillip M., Dev ParvatiComments: An alternative to “traditional clinical medical education” is presented for medical training in the way of experiential learning in simulation environments.( Learning in a variety of simulated environmentsCriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives |Evaluation of these virtual world simulation exercises shows that trainees find them to be adequately realistic to ‘‘suspend disbelief,’’ and they quickly learn to use Internet voice communication and user interface to navigate their online character/avatar to work effectively in a critical care team.1st Study: Training sessions conducted with students/interns randomly assigned either to human-patient simulator (HPS) or to a virtual world (VW) for trauma cases simulations. 2nd Study:3D virtual simulation of 2 worlds for the rapid response to a chemical, biologic, radiologic, nuclear, or highly explosive (CBRNE) incident.3rd Study:Creation of a 3D virtual world replica of the Stanford emergency department for training hospital staff to assess and manage mass casualties after a CBRNE incident. |Three virtual world studies for team training and assessment in acute-care medicine are presented:Training emergency department (ED) teamsPrehospital and in-hospital disaster preparedness trainingTraining ED and hospital staff to manage mass casualties |1st Study: Training sessions conducted with students/interns randomly assigned either to human-patient simulator (HPS) or to a virtual world (VW).

The Controlled Risk Insurance Company (CRICO), Risk Management Foundation (RMF) of the Harvard Medical Institutions pursued simulation as an anesthesia risk control strategy. Encouraged by their success, CRICO/RMF promoted simulation-based team training as a risk control strategy for obstetrical providers. We describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of an obstetric simulation-based team training course grounded in crisis resource management (CRM) principles. Methods: We pursued systematic design of course development, implementation, and evaluation in 3 phases, including a 1-year or more posttraining follow-up with self-assessment questionnaires. Results: The course was highly rated overall by participants immediately after the course and 1-year or more after the course. Most survey responders reported having experienced a critical clinical event since the course and that various aspects of their teamwork had significantly or somewhat improved as a result of the course. Most (86%) reported CRM principles as useful for obstetric faculty and most (59%) recommended repeating the simulation course every 2 years. Conclusions: A simulation-based team-training course for obstetric clinicians was developed and is a central component of CRICO/RMF’s obstetric risk management incentive program that provides a 10% reduction in annual obstetrical malpractice premiums. The course was highly regarded immediately and 1 year or more after completing the course. Most survey responders reported improved teamwork and communication in managing a critical obstetric event in the interval since taking the course. Simulation-based CRM training can serve as a strategy for mitigating adverse perinatal events.|journals.lww.com|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_556 codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/556.pdf|"http://pdfs.journals.lww.com/simulationinhealthcare/2008/00320/Obstetric_Simulation_as_a_Risk_Control_Strategy_.9.pdf?token=method|ExpireAbsolute;source|Journals;ttl|1509715545851;payload|mY8D3u1TCCsNvP5E421JYK6N6XICDamxByyYpaNzk7FKjTaa1Yz22MivkHZqjGP4kdS2v0J76WGAnHACH69s21Csk0OpQi3YbjEMdSoz2UhVybFqQxA7lKwSUlA502zQZr96TQRwhVlocEp/sJ586aVbcBFlltKNKo+tbuMfL73hiPqJliudqs17cHeLcLbV/CqjlP3IO0jGHlHQtJWcICDdAyGJMnpi6RlbEJaRheGeh5z5uvqz3FLHgPKVXJzdD3MPdd3FjhgKoW+anecJJIaVHLgj/ATBk8Zs9MLXI7XDYQx/oIt6ouzwSfJrOk1Y;hash|z8WctA8C8yo/h8XfeQDTPg=="|Gardner Roxane, Walzer Toni B., Simon Robert, Raemer Daniel B.Comments: Learning teamwork via medical simulation, didactic team training, or some combination thereof has penetrated a variety of healthcare professions and specialties.These trainings can be seen as one of several risk reduction activities in obstetrical risk control strategy.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives |A simulation-based team-training course for obstetric clinicians was developed and is a central component of the Controlled Risk Insurance Company (CRICO) / Risk Management Foundation (RMF’s) obstetric risk management incentive program.|Describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of an obstetric simulation-based team training course grounded in crisis resource management (CRM) principles.|Phases:Pilot course development and evaluation of its immediate impactObstetric simulation-based team training course and evaluation (systematic design and implementation)1-year or longer post-course evaluation with self-assessment questionnaires.|Systematic design of course development, implementation, and evaluation in 3 phases, including a 1-year or more post-training follow-up with self-assessment questionnaires.|Self-assessment of team performance on teamworkSelf-assessment of own performance on teamwork|Through simulation + surveys|Chi-square statistics used on the last phase to analyze the results of the questionnaire.||A simulation-based team-training course for multidisciplinary L&D clinicians was developed and now is a central component of a risk management loss prevention program.Formal training in communication and teamwork for L&D clinicians seems to be a plausible strategy for preventing or mitigating adverse perinatal events.|There may be other models of communication and teamwork education that are also effective.

808|Managing the inconceivable: participatory assessments of impacts and responses to extreme climate change|Toth, FL ; Change, E HizsnyikÃ‚Â - Climatic|2008|0|A comprehensive understanding of the implications of extreme climate change requires an in-depth exploration of the perceptions and reactions of the affected stakeholder groups and the lay public. The project on “Atlantic sea level rise: Adaptation to imaginable worst-case climate change” (Atlantis) has studied one such case, the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and a subsequent 5-6 meter sea-level rise. Possible methods are presented for assessing the societal consequences of impacts and adaptation options in selected European regions by involving representatives of pertinent stakeholders. Results of a comprehensive review of participatory integrated assessment methods with a view to their applicability in climate impact studies are summarized including Simulation-Gaming techniques, the Policy Exercise method, and the Focus Group technique. Succinct presentations of these three methods are provided together with short summaries of relevant earlier applications to gain insights into the possible design options. Building on these insights, four basic versions of design procedures suitable for use in the Atlantis project are presented. They draw on design elements of several methods and combine them to fit the characteristics and fulfill the needs of addressing the problem of extreme sea-level rise. The selected participatory techniques and the procedure designs might well be useful in other studies assessing climate change impacts and exploring adaptation options.|Springer|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_808 codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/808.pdf|https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9955/09e82649fd0f3508169690f194af1b051d5e.pdf|Toth Ferenc L., Hizsnyik EvaComments: Presentation of methodological foundations of applying participatory techniques for exploring the perceptions and implications of extreme climate change.

The approach involves several steps for constructing a time-synchronized, event-driven multimedia model of the course of events collected from multiple sources in the operational environment and visualizes this model in the F-REX Studio multimedia suite. In this study, the use of R&E and F-REX is explored in large-scale emergency management exercises. The approach’s possibilities, limitations, and needs for modification are first outlined followed by a comparison to traditional quantitative and qualitative data collection methods applied in the same context. It is found that the R&E approach in combination with F-REX has several advantages in relation to the other methods, in terms of avoiding problems of retrospection and in being able to provide an overview of the entire operation based on multiple perspectives—addressing the question “why” something happened rather than “what happened.” Correctly used, multimedia-supported R&E can thereby be used for more solid evaluations of large-scale emergency management exercises and operations, thus contributing to more effective handling of future crises.|diva-portal.org|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_820 codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/820.pdf|http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:619901/FULLTEXT01.pdf|Pilemalm Sofie, Andersson Dennis, Hallberg NiklasComments: The study explores the use of reconstruction and exploration (R&E) supported by multimedia tools such as F-REX for evaluations of distributed tactical operations (DTOs) in large-scale networked contexts including military, crisis, and emergency management.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives Performed as a case study at a wide large-scale military command and as a|Performed as a case study at a wide large-scale military command and as acontrol exercise (  Swedish Defense area involving participatory observationand complementary group interviews.| Is the R&E approach, supported by proper multimedia technology, applicable to largescale operational contexts and what are its benefits, drawbacks, limitations, and needs for modification to suit these contexts?Main question: How can rich reconstructions based on large-operation factual data, and visualized by multimedia tools, complement, improve, or even replace the use of traditional quantitative or qualitative research methods when evaluating large-scale distributed operations?| The exercise consisted of four linked scenarios played over a period of 2 weeks.Each scenario was followed by short periods of evaluation and debriefingR&E was applied to capture the course of events and reconstruct it in F-REX for further analysis and evaluation.|Case StudiesParticipant observation and interviewsQuantitative method for evaluation of exercises||Notes were collected in a digital log, sometimes complemented with video documentation, eg, of the AAR sessions.

This review demonstrates that only a few of the models have the desired characteristics of fine spatial and temporal resolutions as well as explicit cognitive-behavioral capabilities. Because the criticality of locations varies due to time and/or the day of the week depending on the presence of individuals and the fact that potential targets are specific locations within a city, data needs for modeling these types of scenarios exceed typical planning and forecasting modeling as well as research modeling.

980|Development and evaluation of ontology for intelligent decision support in medical emergency management for mass gatherings|Haghighi, PD ; Burstein, F ; Zaslavsky, A ; Systems, P ArbonÃ‚Â - Decision Support|2013|Intelligent decision support Ontology development and evaluation Medical emergency management Mass gatherings Case-based reasoning Knowledge management|Conducting a safe and successful major event highly depends on the effective provision of medical emergency services that are often offered by different public and private agencies. Poor communication and coordination between these agencies and teams can result in delays in decision-making and duplication of efforts. Another related issue is that emergency decisions are usually made based on individual experience and domain knowledge of relevant managerial personnel. For sustainable knowledge management and more intelligent decision support it is beneficial to collect, consolidate, store and share these experiences in a form of a knowledge base or domain ontology. State-of-the-art surveys identify this gap that there is no common ontology describing the domain knowledge for planning and managing medical services in mass gatherings. Part of the reason is that the process of construction of such an ontology is not a trivial task. In this paper, we describe the process of developing and evaluating a Domain Ontology for Mass Gatherings (DO4MG) with a focus on medical emergency management. As part of the evaluation, we illustrate the application of DO4MG for implementing a case-based reasoning decision support for emergency medical management in mass gatherings. Such an implementation demonstrates the potential of using ontology for resolving terminology inconsistencies and their usefulness for supporting communication between medical emergency personnel in mass gatherings. We also illustrate how this ontology can be applied to different stages of medical emergency management as part of a system architecture. The lessons learnt from building DO4MG for this domain could be beneficial in general to the theory and practice of intelligent decision support and knowledge management in complex problem domains.|Elsevier|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_LL codebook-980.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/980.pdf|https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0167923612003454/1-s2.0-S0167923612003454-main.pdf?_tid=a374bae8-c09a-11e7-b4d2-00000aab0f27&acdnat=1509715786_4439024b46aebb1a8c7ee366475aa53d|emergency management for mass gatheringsPari Delir Haghighi a, Frada Burstein a,⁎, Arkady Zaslavsky b, Paul ArbonComment: very specific domain paper: medical emergency communication and coordination management for mass gatherings, maybe usefull for future Driver+ Trials.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives We describe the application of the ontology within the overall mass gatheringmanagement as an integral part of knowledge management for running|We describe the application of the ontology within the overall mass gatheringmanagement as an integral part of knowledge management for runninga safe event [19].

The network-operation is already supported by simulations providing information about the behavior of the network in real and planned situations. But blackouts nevertheless cannot always be avoided. To mitigate the danger of blackouts it is a precondition, that additional information about the current situation are available in time to support its assessment as well as the decision-making. For this purpose IABG develops an expert system CRIPS1 to support the assessment of current situations and the “strategic decision making” in emergency situations.

METHODS: Training and competency evaluation occurred in 4 phases. In phase one, 24 staff respiratory therapists (RTs) were randomly chosen and individually underwent a simulation-based test of their mini-BAL performance, using a patient-simulator mannequin. Their performance on this test reflected the effectiveness of traditional training methods. In phase two, 83 staff RTs were given unlimited access to a Web-based curriculum on mini-BAL, including a video of a mini-BAL. They then took 2 tests: one online Web-based test, then a patient-simulator test. In phase three, the same 83 RTs attended a workshop that used the patient simulator for training and practice, then were re-evaluated with the patient-simulator test. Phase four was another simulator-based re-evaluation, 90 days after phase three, to study skills retention. RESULTS: The mean scores were: phase one 73  10%, phase two 77  11%, phase three 95  5% (p < 0.01), phase four 92  8%. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that employing simulation technology within a comprehensive departmental program can enhance staff training. Key words: training, bronchoalveolar lavage, simulator.

A probable cause of this lack of improvement could be the number of times that the RTs accessed the Web-based curriculum. The authors do not know how often the Web-based materials were reviewed, because the system was not configured to measure how often the staff accessed the Web material beyond the initial review and online test completion.The simulation training in phase three improved mean staff score to 95%, and the mean score on tasks that require psychomotor function improved, which suggests that this aspect of mini-BAL training can be enhanced with simulationAlthough a direct comparison of skills retention could not be made between the phase-one and phase-four evaluations, the data does indicate that, at least up to 90 days, skill retention is good after simulation training.The authors acknowledge that the study was not designed as a controlled research trial but rather a quality-improvement project that had limitations. Their narrow focus on procedural steps and psychomotor skills excluded testing of cognitive information related to or beyond the procedure.Completion of the mini-BAL training course does not necessarily correlate with improved clinical performanceSeveral practical questions must be addressed when assessing the feasibility and value of simulation training and testing, including cost, training needs, available resources, and number of staff to be trained.The usefulness of simulation technology in training and documenting RT competency for quality assurance and accreditation should be considered and further studied.||

In complex emergency/disaster scenarios, teams from various emergency- response organizations collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. The use of smart mobile devices and applications in these scenarios can improve this collaboration dynamically; and poses interesting challenges, such as user’ mental attention, small screen size, unavailability of reliable network, reduced power, and battery consumption. So, to design and develop interactive applications to be used in mobile and pervasive scenarios requires novel methodologies which combine user-centred design approaches and software engineering approaches tailed for distributed architectures.

To demonstrate how inclusion of the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) as a tool in Public Health Preparedness Capabilities: National Standards for State and Local Planning can increase public health capacity for emergency response. Methods. We reviewed all domestic CASPER activities (i.e., trainings and assessments) between fiscal years 2012 and 2016. Data from these CASPER activities were compared with respect to differences in geographic distribution, type, actions, efficacy, and usefulness of training. Results. During the study period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted 24 domestic in-person CASPER trainings for 1057 staff in 38 states. On average, there was a marked increase in knowledge of CASPER. Ninety-nine CASPERs were conducted in the United States, approximately half of which (53.5%) assessed preparedness; the others were categorized as response or recovery (27.2%) or were unrelated to a disaster (19.2%). Conclusions. CASPER trainings are successful in increasing disaster epidemiology skills. CASPER can be used by Public Health Emergency Preparedness program awardees to help build and sustain preparedness and response capabilities.

Training is essential to enable these nurses to perform an effective disaster response. Evaluating the effects of such training is however complicated as real skill only can be demonstrated during a real major incident. Self-efficacy has been proposed as an alternative measure of training effectiveness. Purpose The aim of this study was to examine if short, small-scale computer-based simulation exercises could improve head emergency nurses' general and specific self-efficacy and initial incident management skills. Method A within-group pretest-posttest design was used to examine 13 head nurses' general and specific self-efficacy before and after an intervention consisting of three short computer based simulation exercises during a 1-h session.

In 2008, the Institute of Medicine released a letter report identifying 4 research priority areas for public health emergency preparedness in public health system research: (1) enhancing the usefulness of training, (2) improving timely emergency communications, (3) creating and maintaining sustainable response systems, and (4) generating effectiveness criteria and metrics. Objectives. To (1) identify and characterize public health system research in public health emergency preparedness produced in the United States from 2009 to 2015, (2) synthesize research findings and assess the level of confidence in these findings, and (3) describe the evolution of knowledge production in public health emergency preparedness system research. Search Methods and Selection Criteria. We reviewed and included the titles and abstracts of 1584 articles derived from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and gray literature databases that focused on the organizational or financial aspects of public health emergency preparedness activities and were grounded on empirical studies. Data Collection and Analysis. We included 156 articles. We appraised the quality of the studies according to the study design.We identified themes during article analysis and summarized overall findings by theme. We determined level of confidence in the findings with the GRADE-CERQual tool. Main Results. Thirty-one studies provided evidence on how to enhance the usefulness of training. Results demonstrated the utility of drills and exercises to enhance decision-making capabilities and coordination across organizations, the benefit of cross-sector partnerships for successfully implementing training activities, and the value of integrating evaluation methods to support training improvement efforts. Thirty-six studies provided evidence on how to improve timely communications. Results supported the use of communication strategies that address differences in access to information, knowledge, attitudes, and practices across segments of the population as well as evidence on specific communication barriers experienced by public health and health care personnel. Forty-eight studies provided evidence on how to create and sustain preparedness systems. Results included how to build social capital across organizations and citizens and how to develop sustainable and useful planning efforts that maintain flexibility and rely on available medical data. Twenty-six studies provided evidence on the usefulness of measurement efforts, such as community and organizational needs assessments, and new methods to learn from the response to critical incidents. Conclusions: In the United States, the field of public health emergency preparedness system research has been supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since the release of the 2008 Institute of Medicine letter report. The first definition of public health emergency preparedness appeared in 2007, and before 2008 there was a lack of research and empirical evidence across all 4 research areas identified by the Institute of Medicine. This field can be considered relatively new compared with other research areas in public health; for example, tobacco control research can rely on more than 70 years of knowledge production. However, this review demonstrates that, during the past 7 years, public health emergency preparedness system research has evolved from generic inquiry to the analysis of specific interventions with more empirical studies. Public Health Implications: The results of this review provide an evidence base for public health practitioners responsible for enhancing key components of preparedness and response such as communication, training, and planning efforts.

As well as on the best ways to disseminate existing knowledge that does not reach practitioners. Thus, this review should be considered only a first step in this direction.Future steps will consist in combining these results with feedback from practitioners engaged in preparedness efforts.||

The developed model integrates the real-time process dynamic simulation with 3DCFD accident simulation in a designed interface using object linking and embedding technology so that it can convey to trainees the online information of the accident which is not available in existing operator training systems. The model encompasses the whole process of data transfer till the end of the training at which a trainee operates an emergency shutdown system in a programmed model. In this work, an overall scenario is simulated which is from an abnormal increase in the main valve discharge (second) pressure due to valve malfunction to accidental gas release through the crack of a pressure recorder, and the magnitude of the accident with respect to the lead time of each trainee's emergency response is analyzed. The model can improve the effectiveness of the operator training system through interactively linking the trainee actions with the simulation model resulting in different accident scenarios with respect to each trainee's competence when facing an accident.

1431|Traffic evacuation simulation based on multi-level driving decision model.|Yuan, Shengcheng ; Chun, Soon Ae ; Spinelli, Bruno ; Liu, Yi ; Zhang, Hui ; Adam, Nabil R.|2017|EMERGENCY management;DECISION making;SIMULATION methods & models;AUTOMOBILE driving;TRAFFIC congestion;Emergency management;Mass evacuation;Model integration;Multi-agent systems;Multi-level driving decision model;Traffic simulation|Traffic evacuation is a critical task in disaster management. Planning its evacuation in advance requires taking many factors into consideration such as the destination shelter locations and numbers, the number of vehicles to clear, the traffic congestions as well as traffic road configurations. A traffic evacuation simulation tool can provide the emergency managers with the flexibility of exploring various scenarios for identifying more accurate model to plan their evacuation. This paper presents a traffic evacuation simulation system based on integrated multi-level driving-decision models which generate agentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ behavior in a unified framework. In this framework, each agent undergoes a Strategic, Cognitive, Tactical and Operational (SCTO) decision process, in order to make a driving decision. An agentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions are determined by a combination, on each process level, of various existing behavior models widely used in different driving simulation models. A wide spectrum of variability in each agentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision and driving behaviors, such as in pre-evacuation activities, in choice of route, and in the following or overtaking the car ahead, are represented in the SCTO decision process models to simulate various scenarios. We present the formal model for the agent and the multi-level decision models. A prototype simulation system that reflects the multi-level driving-decision process modeling is developed and implemented. Our SCTO framework is validated by comparing with MATSim tool, and the experimental results of evacuation simulation models are compared with the existing evacuation plan for densely populated Beijing, China in terms of various performance metrics. Our simulation system shows promising results to support emergency managers in designing and evaluating more realistic traffic evacuation plans with multi-level agentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision models that reflect different levels of individual variability of handling stress situations. The flexible combination of existing behavior and decision models can help generating the best evacuation plan to manage each crisis with unique characteristics, rather than resorting to a fixed evacuation plan.

This need is not least in the area of human-computer interaction, which includes a rich culture of carrying out usability evaluations in many different domains and technology platforms. This paper aims to show how transfer of methods takes place, by explicating and formalizing the process. It will contribute to the quest for knowledge on the constituents of the process of transferring methodological knowledge and their relationships. A sectoral system of innovation approach is used to analyse the constituents of a selected sector, crisis management, where training is essential and which is rapidly adopting technology for operations and training. Two case studies are described where heuristics evaluation and user testing were applied on simulation software that allows training for crisis management. The analysis results in a process model, describing the transfer of methodological knowledge within the sectoral system of innovation framework.

1465|Testing a methodology to improve organizational learning about crisis communication by public organizations.|Palttala, Paulina ; Vos, Marita|2011|Crisis communication;Crisis management;Communication methodology;Problem solving;Organizational learning;Organizational performance;Communication management;Disaster management;Emergency communication;Performance indicators;Quality control|Purpose Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The purpose of this paper is to test a measurement system with performance indicators to improve organizational learning about crisis communication by public organizations enhancing public safety in large scale emergencies. The tool can be used to conduct a preparedness audit or to evaluate communication performance in a real situation or in an emergency exercise. Evaluation is part of the strategic planning and development of crisis communication. Design/methodology/approach Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The construction of the instrument and its theoretical underpinnings are first explained, after which the series of empirical tests that were implemented to scrutinize the clarity and appropriateness of the indicators as well as the usability of the instrument are presented. The process approach to crisis management, in which the various phases of a crisis are seen as a continuum, and the stakeholder perspective, in which both the diversity of public groups and the network of response organizations are taken into account, are applied in the paper. Findings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The tests of the instrument revealed much interest in its use, and it was seen as a potential tool for the improvement by public organizations of their crisis communication. The tests led to improvements in the structure as well as in the phrasing of the individual performance indicators and their explanation. The indicators were considered relevant and important but too many in number. Therefore, a possibility to use the instrument in three separate parts, relating respectively to the period before, during and after a crisis, should be offered. Research limitations/implications Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This study addresses the main factors relevant for crisis communication with respect to the approach chosen, but does not report all the literature and empirical findings that validate the individual indicators as this has been done in other publications. It also presents a series of first test findings but not as yet the results of improvements initiated by using the instrument. Practical implications Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The instrument developed shows weak and strong points in crisis communication on the level of single indicators, but also allows comparison of performance in different phases and for the various stakeholder groups, showing where more attention is needed. The instrument developed will be available on an open web site and users will be asked to make the measurement results, rendered anonymous, available for its further improvement. Social implications Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The paper contributes to effectiveness of emergency management by testing an instrument to facilitate learning about crisis communication. Originality/value Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Much of the crisis communication literature focuses on reputation crises. This paper discusses crisis communication supporting crisis management in the case of disasters and other emergencies that are handled by a response network instead a single organization. It provides a clear framework for analysing and assessing the quality of crisis communication and stimulates and thus enables learning and further improvement.

They facilitate information sharing that is required for efficient coordination of critical infrastructures. Poor quality or nonexistent communications can have crippling effects on disaster response, adding unwanted delays to response time and in the worst case totally isolating vulnerable individuals from critical care. User engagement with communication infrastructure can also have considerable effects on delay times in responses. This paper presents a framework for examining the way in which communication system availability, quality, and user engagement affect delays in disaster response. Closed-form statistical communication network models are derived and nested within a procedural metalayer which incorporates human interaction to determine communication delays in a response. The simulation tool was developed in MATLAB/Simulink and tested on a hypothetical case involving an oil and gas industry. The tool can be used in analyzing existing procedures governing the use of communication technologies during an emergency. It can also be used in evaluating the benefits of implementing new systems and redundancies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]/nCopyright of IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man & Cybernetics.

The lack of consistent data standards for current emergency management practice, however, hinders efficient critical information flow among incident responders. In this paper, we adopt a third-generation activity theory guided approach to develop a data model that can be used in the response to fire-related extreme events. This data model prescribes the core data standards to reduce information inter operability barriers. The model is validated through a three-step approach including a request for comment (RFC) process, case application, and prototype system test. This study contributes to the literature in the area of interoperability and data modeling; it also informs practice in emergency response system design.

The participants (n=393) are recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk system (Mturks). Findings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The findings suggest that using Twitter substantially mitigates participantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ negative evaluation of the organization undergoing a crisis. Country-of-origin affects how individuals perceive the organization after it has experienced a crisis. In addition, participantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ product involvement intensifies the reputational threat specifically for the organization with a less favorable country-of-origin perception.

This investigation reinforces the need to consider social media not just at the individual level, but also as a form of communication that can have broader consequences at the organizational level. In addition, it is important for company leaders to understand that the organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home country image may exacerbate the negative management outcomes during a crisis. It is expected that this study yields theoretically indicative, empirically informative, and culturally relevant results.

1514|High Fidelity Simulation to Evaluate Emergency Management in Urgent Care Centers.|Tabor, Megan ; Vaughn, Brooke L.|2017|Ambulatory Care Facilities;Emergency Service;Simulations -- Evaluation;Cardiac Patients;Models, Anatomic;Health Personnel;Clinical Competence|A large amount of literature discusses the use of simulation in academic and acute care settings, but few report the use of simulation in the urgent care setting or to train unlicensed personnel. Staff members in this setting are responsible for managing emergencies until emergency medical services (EMS) respond. Cardiac emergencies in the urgent care setting are reported as acute low volume events, creating difficulties in preparation of staff. Inconsistencies were discovered with staff in managing emergency situations at twelve urgent care centers in the metropolitan area. A clinical educator partnered with a university simulation educator to develop an in-situ cardiac emergency scenario. The researchers evaluated the effect of simulation on competency of urgent care staff in managing a cardiac emergency prior to the arrival of EMS. A convenience sample of 128 urgent care staff precipitated in a chest pain scenario using a high fidelity simulator. It was completed one time at each urgent care center. Participants included: RNs, LPNs, medical assistants, radiology technicians and receptionists. Scenario objectives included: recognizing a potentially life-threatening patient condition, implementing center protocol to notify EMS, management of a patient with basic life support upon arrival of EMS and evaluation of the team's performance. The Simulation Effectiveness Tool and Creighton Competency Evaluation Instrument (CCEI) were used to evaluate the experience. Participants were highly engaged, reflecting on all aspects of the simulation. Opportunities for learning were identified by participants relating to the CCEI criteria, including thorough system processes and effective communication with the team. Competent behaviors in managing emergencies did not correlate with previous experience in managing cardiac emergencies or years of experience in employee role. These reasons indicate a need for continued simulation experiences in the urgent care setting. It is recommended that health care systems continue to collaborate with universities to implement simulation. Simulation was found to be an effective way to identify areas for continued education and simultaneously provide quality training for unlicensed personnel to produce better patient outcomes in the urgent care setting.|Kentucky Nurse|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/1514.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1514.pdf|http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1525-1446.2010.00838.x/epdf|Morrison, A.M; Catanzaro, A.MComments: Using Institute of Medicine recommendations and Quality and Safety Education for Nurses competencies, the authors describe a public health emergency simulation exercise with undergraduate senior nursing students enrolled in a public health clinical course.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives Students participated in two separate simulated infectious disease outbreaks and were required to assume various responder and leadership roles as well as various casualty roles|Students participated in two separate simulated infectious disease outbreaks and were required to assume various responder and leadership roles as well as various casualty rolesThe infectious disease outbreak exercises took placein a simulated large, crowded urban high school thatserved a vulnerable and underserved population ofhigh school students.|Describe a public health emergency simulation exercise with undergraduate senior nursing students enrolled in a public health clinical course|Students wpuld have to use their assessment skills, communication skills, triage skills, patient safety skills, collaborative skills, documentations skills, and leadership skills to effectively manage the presenting infectious disease emergency while addressing other health-related conditions.|Simulation, qualitative research|--|Simulation and qualitative evaluation ( verbal briefing as group activity and written reflection by each individual after each simulation.|Simulation|NA|This public health emergency preparedness simulation exercise of infectious disease outbreaks can be a useful learning strategy at other educational institutions an  can be easily replicatedOur first recommendation is that presimulation briefing time should be increased from 15 to 30min.We also suggest adding an informatics component in the actual simulation.

1520|Challenges in coordination: differences in perception of civil and military organizations by comparing international scientific literature and field experiences.|Pramanik, Roshni|2015|EMERGENCY management;INTERNATIONAL cooperation;COORDINATION (Human services);RISK perception;SCIENTIFIC literature;PREJUDICES;civilÃ¢â‚¬â€œmilitary coordination;international disaster response operations;perception of challenges|The extreme pressure resulting from modern-day disasters in terms of severe shortages of resources, mass casualties, infrastructure breakdown, large-scale damage and their impact necessitate coordination between all the agencies involved in disaster response. Better coordination in international disaster response operations will make them more effective in organizing the different phases of relief, rehabilitation and recovery. Recent disasters such as the hurricane Katrina, the Indian Ocean tsunami and the earthquake in Haiti have seen multiple civil agencies and the military working together. However, challenges have been identified in civilÃ¢â‚¬â€œmilitary coordination. Differences in working procedures and a lack of knowledge on the otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organizational identities resulted in stereotyping and prejudices, which are root obstacles to coordination. The aim of this study was to identify the perception-related challenges in civilÃ¢â‚¬â€œmilitary coordination, and how they are perceived in the field by civil and military teams, and to investigate whether perception-related challenges and their implications have been reported in the international literature. A systematic literature review and 12 semi-structured interviews were carried out to answer these questions. Nine out of the 12 respondents were practitioners from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and the Swedish military, with experience of international disaster response missions that involved civilÃ¢â‚¬â€œmilitary interactions, and 3 were trainees from Karlberg Military Academy, Stockholm, who were expected to participate in similar operations in the near future. The questions asked during the interviews were based on the systematic literature review. National backgrounds, attitudes and perceptions of the professionals towards the other organization were found to be key factors influencing civilÃ¢â‚¬â€œmilitary coordination. This indicates that comparisons between the perceptions of professionals from both civil and military teams with different nationalities and different political histories should be carried out in future research.

The unpredictability and complexity of emergencies makes training in every possible emergency impossible. Rather than training in specific examples of major emergency events, training in a decision-making skill set will provide a method of response that will be transferable to all emergencies. Various scenarios will support the training as a decision needs a context for application. The resulting educational tool will focus on emergency services at the strategic and tactical levels in the response stage of an emergency. The continual engagement of stakeholder should result in a purpose-built training course. Design science research approach will be utilised, investigating connections between theories of cognitive load and expert performance. Key aspects of the developed training course will include the concepts of metrics, deliberate practice and proficiency based progression, to ensure an appropriate training programme rather than a mere educational experience.

1524|Towards the development of a decision support system for multi-agency decision-making during cross-border emergencies.|Neville, Karen ; O'Riordan, Sheila ; Pope, Andrew ; Rauner, Marion ; Rochford, Maria ; Madden, Martina ; Sweeney, James ; Nussbaumer, Alexander ; McCarthy, Nora ; OÃ¢â‚¬ËœBrien, Cian|2016|Decision support systems;emergency management;disasters;cross-border;multi-agency response;decision-making;2016;Decision Support Systems;Emergency Preparedness;Emergency Services;2016|Developing decision support systems for emergency situations is a complex and challenging task. These difficulties are compounded further in the case of cross-border emergencies, which often require the coordination and collaboration of independent agencies. These agencies have different structures and resources in place, and follow their own internal policies and procedures. If a number of countries have been affected, agencies may not even share the same language. Large-scale disasters, whether natural, deliberate, or accidental do not respect borders and come with a high risk to human life and a variety of economic and health impacts. Thus, it is the aim of the S-HELP (Securing-Health Emergency Learning Planning) project to develop a decision support tool-set that supports multi-agency decision-making during cross-border emergencies. S-HELP seeks to provide a tool-set that supports rapid and effective decision-making across all stages of the emergency management lifecycle (i.e. mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery). To address the challenges associated with multi-agency emergency management, a holistic framed approach to healthcare preparedness, response, and recovery is proposed. This holistic framework has been created to guide the development of the S-HELP solution. The framework integrates a number of components important in the phased iterative development of an emergency management decision support system, such as, interoperability standards, risk communication, spatial data management, agile development, healthcare responder training, and scenario development for system evaluation.

Medical residents participated in a simulation exercise designed to help trainees to develop medical expertise, effective leadership, and team management skills. Purposive sampling was used to select one team for case study based on overall performance. Video and audio data were collected from the simulation and debriefing session and a follow-up interview was conducted with the team leader. Performance measures were also collected from expert raters (i.e., experienced staff physicians). Video data were reviewed and coded for cognitive, metacognitive, and emotional events exhibited by team members during the simulation. Interview and debriefing transcripts were coded for themes related to these regulatory processes. Results from quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed that the team exhibited lower-order cognitive and metacognitive process (e.g., summarizing, providing information) more often than higher-order processes (e.g., evaluation, reasoning). Furthermore, team members expressed negative emotions (e.g., anxiety) more often than positive emotions (e.g., enjoyment). Chi square analyses of the team leader revealed that negative emotions were significantly more frequently preceded by lower-order processes compared to higher-order processes. Qualitative thematic analyses provided further corroboration of these findings. The findings suggest that medical trainees (particularly teams experiencing difficulty managing a challenging case) may require further scaffolding in their use of regulatory processes within medical emergencies. The results from this study are discussed in terms of implications for theories of self-regulation, methodological advances, and instructional design for medical education.

Emergency Medicine residency programs have very high curriculum commitments, and adding Disaster Medicine training to this busy schedule can be difficult. Development of a short Disaster Medicine curriculum that is effective and enjoyable for the participants may be a valuable addition to Emergency Medicine residency training. Methods: A simulation-based curriculum was developed. The curriculum included four group exercises in which the participants developed a disaster plan for a simulated hospital. This was followed by a disaster simulation using the Disastermed.Ca Emergency Disaster Simulator computer software Version 3.5.2 (Disastermed.Ca, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) and the disaster plan developed by the participants. Progress was assessed by a pre- and post-test, resident evaluations, faculty evaluation of Command and Control, and markers obtained from the Disastermed.Ca software. Results: Twenty-five residents agreed to partake in the training curriculum. Seventeen completed the simulation. There was no statistically significant difference in pre- and post-test scores. Residents indicated that they felt the curriculum had been useful, and judged it to be preferable to a didactic curriculum. In addition, the residents' confidence in their ability to manage a disaster increased on both a personal and and a departmental level. Conclusions: A simulation-based model of Disaster Medicine training, requiring approximately eight hours of classroom time, was judged by Emergency Medicine residents to be a valuable component of their medical training, and increased their confidence in personal and departmental disaster management capabilities.|Prehospital & Disaster Medicine|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_LL codebook_1548.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1548.pdf|https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/6BD3683B4D3C32B5DB2CD207EABAF6BA/S1049023X11006807a.pdf/increasing_emergency_medicine_residents_confidence_in_disaster_management_use_of_an_emergency_department_simulator_and_an_expedited_curriculum.pdf|Jeffrey Michael Franc; Darren Nichols; Sandy L.

As the scale and complexity of disasters increase, so do the information management, decision-making, and leadership challenges. This paper focuses on educating students through the application of systems engineering principles in a simulated bioterrorism event. We describe a workshop that included a tabletop scenario exercise to familiarize a mix of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with systems analysis and decision making during real-world events. Bridging the data and information management and translation-to-knowledge functions through triage of information to create actionable information arguably represents the most critical and vulnerable link in the information fusion process. We conclude the paper with a description of the methodology used to evaluate the learning approach.

To react effectively, responders need to know the right actions to take given the risks posed by the emergency. While existing research on risk scales focuses primarily on decision making in static environments with known risks, these scales may be inappropriate for conditions where the decision maker's time and mental resources are limited and may be infeasible if the actual risk probabilities are unknown. In this article, we propose a method to develop context-specific, scenario-based risk scales designed for emergency response training. Emergency scenarios are used as scale points, reducing our dependence on known probabilities; these are drawn from the targeted emergency context, reducing the mental resources required to interpret the scale. The scale is developed by asking trainers/trainees to rank order a range of risk scenarios and then aggregating these orderings using a Kemeny ranking. We propose measures to assess this aggregated scale's internal consistency, reliability, and validity, and we discuss how to use the scale effectively. We demonstrate our process by developing a risk scale for subsurface coal mine emergencies and test the reliability of the scale by repeating the process, with some methodological variations, several months later.

Several decision-aiding tools have been developed to prevent and mitigate the effects of a radiation accident. This work reviews a range of mathematical models, computing tools and, particularly, multi-criteria decision-making techniques that have been applied in the last 25 years to help politicians, health officials, local authority representatives and emergency planning officers devise better countermeasure strategies in the event of a radiation accident. The paper discusses all phases of a nuclear emergency as well as emergency training and planning. It highlights what has been achieved in the application of multi-criteria decision analysis, mainly through initiatives such as the EU-funded real-time online decision support projects. It examines how such tools that have been developed fit into the formulation, evaluation and appraisal stages of the emergency management process and discusses the complex socio-technical issues that arise from radiation accidents.

Purpose: We investigated the effects of work-related factors on the mental health of prefectural public servants working in the area devastated by the Great East Japan Earthquake to identify some ideas for organizational work modifications to protect their mental health. Methods: Two months after the earthquake, Miyagi prefecture conducted a self-administered health survey of prefectural public servants and obtained 4,331 (82.8 %) valid responses. We investigated relationships between mental health distress (defined as K6 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 13) and work-related variables (i.e., job type, overwork, and working environment) stratified by level of earthquake damage experienced. Results: The proportion of participants with mental health distress was 3.0 % in the group that experienced less damage and 5.9 % in the group that experienced severe damage. In the group that experienced less damage, working >100 h of overtime per month (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.06; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.11-3.82) and poor workplace communication (adjusted OR, 10.96; 95 % CI, 6.63-18.09) increased the risk of mental health distress. In the group that experienced severe damage, handling residents' complaints (adjusted OR, 4.79; 95 % CI, 1.55-14.82) and poor workplace communication (adjusted OR, 9.14; 95 % CI, 3.34-24.97) increased the risk, whereas involvement in disaster-related work (adjusted OR, 0.39; 95 % CI, 0.18-0.86) decreased the risk. Conclusions: Workers who have experienced less disaster-related damage might benefit from working fewer overtime hours, and those who have experienced severe damage might benefit from avoiding contact with residents and engaging in disaster-related work. Facilitating workplace communication appeared important for both groups of workers.

The usual methods of preparedness, such as pre-positioning relief inventory in countries prone to disasters, are problematic because they require high investment in various locations, due to the uncertainty about the timing and location of the next disaster. Investing in disaster management capabilities, such as training staff, pre-negotiating customs agreements with countries prone to disasters, or harmonizing import procedures with local customs clearance procedures, has been recognized as a way to overcome this constraint. By means of system dynamics modeling, we model the delivery process of ready-to-use therapeutic food items during the immediate response phase of a disaster, and we analyze the performance of different preparedness scenarios. We find that pre-positioning inventory produces positive results for the beneficiaries, but at extremely high costs. Investing in disaster management capabilities is an interesting alternative, as it allows lead time reductions of up to 67% (18 days) compared to a scenario without preparedness, at significantly lower costs than pre-positioning inventory. We find that the best performance can be achieved when combining both preparedness strategies, allocating part of the available funding to disaster management capabilities and part to pre-positioning inventory. We analyze 2828 such combined scenarios to identify the best mix of preparedness strategies for different levels of available funding. On the basis of our findings, we provide recommendations for relief organizations on how to allocate their preparedness budget.|International Journal of Production Economics|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_LL codebook_1581.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1581.pdf|https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0925527313004611/1-s2.0-S0925527313004611-main.pdf?_tid=cb05e384-c09f-11e7-ba94-00000aab0f27&acdnat=1509717999_0621370d19926b6e69c9c0701c81caf4|Comments: Further literature for the categories human resources, knowledge management, process management, resources and community are presented.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives By comparing a scenario without preparedness with one in which supplies have been pre-positioned in the country and one in which investments in disaster management capabilities (DMC) have been made, we demonstrate the strong improvement potential of disaster preparedness activities.Research questions How does pre-positioning inventory and investing in DMC improve the delivery of relief supplies during the immediate disaster response, in comparison to an import scenario without preparedness?|By comparing a scenario without preparedness with one in which supplies have been pre-positioned in the country and one in which investments in disaster management capabilities (DMC) have been made, we demonstrate the strong improvement potential of disaster preparedness activities.|How does pre-positioning inventory and investing in DMC improve the delivery of relief supplies during the immediate disaster response, in comparison to an import scenario without preparedness?

1582|Proposing 'the burns suite' as a novel simulation tool for advancing the delivery of burns education.|Sadideen, Hazim ; Wilson, David ; Moiemen, Naiem ; Kneebone, Roger|2014|Burns -- Therapy;Emergency Medicine -- Education;Surgery, Operative -- Education;Patient Simulation;Pediatrics -- Education;Adult;Clinical Competence;Female;Human;Interviews;Male;Questionnaires|Educational theory highlights the importance of contextualized simulation for effective learning. We explored this concept in a burns scenario in a novel, low-cost, high-fidelity, portable, immersive simulation environment (referred to as distributed simulation). This contextualized simulation/distributed simulation combination was named 'The Burns Suite' (TBS). A pediatric burn resuscitation scenario was selected after high trainee demand. It was designed on Advanced Trauma and Life Support and Emergency Management of Severe Burns principles and refined using expert opinion through cognitive task analysis. TBS contained 'realism' props, briefed nurses, and a simulated patient. Novices and experts were recruited. Five-point Likert-type questionnaires were developed for face and content validity. Cronbach's [alpha] was calculated for scale reliability. Semistructured interviews captured responses for qualitative thematic analysis allowing for data triangulation. Twelve participants completed TBS scenario. Mean face and content validity ratings were high (4.6 and 4.5, respectively; range, 4-5). The internal consistency of questions was high. Qualitative data analysis revealed that participants felt 1) the experience was 'real' and they were 'able to behave as if in a real resuscitation environment,' and 2) TBS 'addressed what Advanced Trauma and Life Support and Emergency Management of Severe Burns didn't' (including the efficacy of incorporating nontechnical skills). TBS provides a novel, effective simulation tool to significantly advance the delivery of burns education. Recreating clinical challenge is crucial to optimize simulation training. This low-cost approach also has major implications for surgical education, particularly during increasing financial austerity. Alternative scenarios and/or procedures can be recreated within TBS, providing a diverse educational immersive simulation experience.|Journal of Burn Care & Research|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_LL codebook_1582.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1582.pdf|http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/ovftpdfs/FPDDNCGCNDNKAH00/fs046/ovft/live/gv023/01253092/01253092-201401000-00009.pdf|Hazim Sadideen, MEd, MRCS, David Wilson FRCS (Plast), Naiem Moiemen FRCS (Plast), Roger Kneebone PhD, FRCS2013Comments: medical emergency, surgical/burns educationMinor relevant for DRIVER+, Though it tackles questions such as team coordination in crisis situations and simulation approaches.DUBLICATION (1582)CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives |We explored this concept in a burns scenario in a novel, low-cost, high-fidelity, portable, immersive simulation environment (referred to as distributed simulation).

1583|Using Real-Time Decision Tools to Improve Distributed Decision-Making Capabilities in High-Magnitude Crisis Situations.|Moskowitz, Herbert ; Drnevich, Paul ; Ersoy, Okan ; Altinkemer, Kemal ; Chaturvedi, Alok|2011|DECISION making;CRISIS management;DECISION support systems;INFORMATION technology;MACHINE learning;SUPPORT vector machines;and Support Vector Machines (SVM);Distributed Decision Making;Dynamic Modeling;Information Technology (IT) based Decision Support Systems;Machine Learning Algorithms;Multi-Organizational Collaborative Decision Making;Real-Time Decision Tools|Multi-organizational collaborative decision making in high-magnitude crisis situations requires real-time information sharing and dynamic modeling for effective response. Information technology (IT) based decision support tools can play a key role in facilitating such effective response. We explore one promising class of decision support tools based on machine learning, known as support vector machines (SVM), which have the capability to dynamically model and analyze decision processes. To examine this capability, we use a case study with a design science approach to evaluate improved decision-making effectiveness of an SVM algorithm in an agent-based simulation experimental environment. Testing and evaluation of real-time decision support tools in simulated environments provides an opportunity to assess their value under various dynamic conditions. Decision making in high-magnitude crisis situations involves multiple different patterns of behavior, requiring the development, application, and evaluation of different models. Therefore, we employ a multistage linear support vector machine (MLSVM) algorithm that permits partitioning decision maker response into behavioral subsets, which can then individually model and examine their diverse patterns of response behavior. The results of our case study indicate that our MLSVM is clearly superior to both single stage SVMs and traditional approaches such as linear and quadratic discriminant analysis for understanding and predicting behavior. We conclude that machine learning algorithms show promise for quickly assessing response strategy behavior and for providing the capability to share information with decision makers in multi-organizational collaborative environments, thus supporting more effective decision making in such contexts.

Design A descriptive, cross-sectional research design was used in this study. Methods Two hundred nurses were invited to participate in the study, with 170 responses (105 hospital nurses and 65 community nurses) or an 85% response rate, during the months of April 2014 through July 2014. Data collection was based on interviews using a standardized instrument, the Disaster Preparedness Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, means, percentages, and standard deviations were utilized to quantify the responses. Results Three fourths of the respondents ( n = 136, 80%) indicated that they were not fully prepared to respond to disasters, while only 20% ( n = 34) acknowledged that they felt they were adequately prepared. Respondents believed that they could function in the primary roles of educator ( n = 107, 62.94%), caregiver ( n = 104, 61.17%), and counselor ( n = 82, 48.24%). More than half of the respondents ( n = 98, 57.7%) were not aware of existing protocols of disaster management in the workplace. Courses taken in such areas as first aid ( n = 79, 46.4%), field triage ( n = 43, 25.29%), and basic cardiac life support ( n = 57, 33.53%) were cited as important in preparing for disasters. Conclusions Nurses in the study revealed that they were not sufficiently prepared for disasters nor were they aware of disaster management protocols in the workplace.

Despite this need, there is scarce theory-grounded research to understand key factors that affect how publics consume crisis information via social media compared to other sources. To fill this gap, an emerging model helps crisis managers understand how publics produce, consume, and/or share crisis information via social media and other sources: the social-mediated crisis communication model (SMCC). This study tests essential components of the SMCC model through a 3 (crisis information form) x 2 (crisis information source) x 2 (crisis origin) mixed-design experiment (N = 338). The findings indicate the key role of crisis origin in affecting publicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ preferred information form (social media, traditional media, or word-of-mouth communication) and source (organization in crisis or third party), which influences how publics anticipate an organization should respond to a crisis and what crisis emotions they are likely to feel when exposed to crisis information.

Despite its theoretical and practical significance, however, the dynamics of control within disrupted settings (such as disasters) remain poorly understood. Here, we shed light on this question by a reexamination of historical data on multiorganizational disaster response networks, using recently developed statistical methods for robust inference from error-prone informant reports. Specifically, we test competing hypotheses about the relationship of control during the response process to the structure of interorganizational communication. We find that both the realized and normative response hierarchies are likely shaped by coordination among both nonadjacent alters and along indirect channels. Our results suggested that the communication structure of these networks is consistent with a control at a distance model of command. This article makes a substantial contribution to understanding the role of network structure in the emergence of control between organizations in disrupted settings. Additionally, our innovative approach to network inference will guide researchers in dealing with error-prone data in their own research on policy networks.

1594|Does message placement influence risk perception and affect?|Lachlan, Kenneth ; Spence, Patric R.|2014|Risk communication;Crisis management research;Crisis communication research;Risk perception;Fear;Cognition;Crisis communication;Crisis management;Risk awareness|Purpose Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A recent body of research in crisis communications suggests that risk awareness and negative affect concerning a risk may be separate psychological constructs. These constructs may have independent and combined implications for crisis communication practitioners, in terms of message placement and audience responses. Making affected audiences aware of the nature of a risk, and coupling this awareness with an appropriate degree of negative affect, may be critical in motivating individuals to take action to protect themselves. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the above issues. Design/methodology/approach Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In order to explore the best outlets for inducing risk awareness and appropriate levels of negative affect, an experimental study explored the influence of print, video, and combined messages on these factors. The experiment also examined whether or not order of presentation of print and video messages would be relevant. Findings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The findings indicate that the use of organization-produced messages placed in print media may reduce negative affect, while the order of presentation in multimedia approaches may have little effect on either construct. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for those crafting public messages concerning developing crises, while suggesting that organizations must consider the highly arousing nature of televised risk messages when informing and persuading the public. Originality/value Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This study moves the literature a step forward by offering an empirical assessment of the value of an organizational message in reducing negative affect. It moves beyond past studies exploring the combined impact of risk awareness and affect by examining their relationship with placement strategy, and does so by measuring actual audience reactions.

1603|Improving Communication in Crisis Management by Evaluating the Relevance of Messages.|Netten, Niels ; van Someren, Maarten|2011|COMMUNICATION & technology;CRISIS management;INFORMATION resources management;CONFLICT of interests;ELECTRONIC systems|Efficient communication is a major challenge for emergency responders during crisis management. Reports show that missing information and information overload are important factors that determine the success of crisis management. We propose a method as basis for a software system that improves text or voice-based communication. Communication is split into segments and the system determines from the content of the communication, the tasks of actors and their locations for which responders in the crisis the information is relevant. The system is tested on data recorded at a fire fighting disaster management exercise and found to be accurate enough to be useful.

It illustrates the application of a multicriteria decision-making process to supplier selection within a service setting where it is less common than in a manufacturing context. To implement the study, a survey instrument was created and submitted to Taiwanese hospitality firms, namely hotels and restaurants, to identify contributing factors in the selection of a seafood supplier within six initial areas concerning food hygiene, staff training, crisis management, information technology, competitive ability, and logistics and quality assurance. The analytic hierarchical process (AHP) was then applied to the survey results, and the first- and second-level hierarchical factors were rigorously identified and ranked. These can be regarded as useful benchmarks in identifying and ranking the selection and evaluation of a food supplier within the industry. The present study enhances the understanding of supplier selection in the hospitality industry and provides insights which hospitality firms can apply in managing their supply chains.

Analysis was framed by defining effective emergency management as a person-environment fit process in which both person (competence, response management system) and environment (e.g., need for multi-agency response, decision making about complex, evolving emergencies) characteristics should be modelled in training. Each organisation was unique in their approach and the extent their EOC was active during training. Training tended to focus on implementing the structural model (e.g., CIMS) and less on developing the competencies necessary for people to operate effectively at a tactical or coordinating level of emergency management. There was recognition of a need to further develop approaches to training, with 63% of organisations stating that they would like more guidance and advice in emergency management training.

Such practices can optimise cross-border collaboration. A wide range of practices have been implemented across MSs during chemical incident response, particularly during incidents that have cross-border and trans-boundary impacts. This paper proposes a self-assessment methodology to enable MSs, or organisations within MSs, to examine exposure assessment capabilities and communication pathways between exposure assessors and public health risk assessors. Where gaps exist, this methodology provides links to good practices that could improve response, communication and collaboration across local, regional and national borders. A fragmented approach to emergency preparedness for chemical incidents is a major obstacle to improving cross-border exposure assessment. There is no one existing body or structure responsible for all aspects of chemical incident preparedness and response in the European Union. Due to the range of different organisations and networks involved in chemical incident response, emergency preparedness needs to be drawn together. A number of recommendations are proposed, including the use of networks of experts which link public health risk assessors with experts in exposure assessment, in order to coordinate and improve chemical incident emergency preparedness. The EU's recent Decision on serious cross-border threats to health aims to facilitate MSs' compliance with the International Health Regulations, which require reporting and communication regarding significant chemical incidents. This provides a potential route to build on in order to improve chemical incident preparedness and response across Europe.

It has become easy to develop virtual environments to support games, to have players at distributed workstations interacting with each other, to have automated controllers supply exogenous events to the players, to enable players to query online data files during the game, and to prepare presentation graphics for use during the game and for post-game debriefings. Videos can be used to present scenario updates to players in Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬ËœnewscastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ format and to present pre-taped briefings by experts to players. Organizations responsible for crisis management are already using such technologies in constructing crisis management systems (CMSs) to coordinate response to a crisis, provide decision support during a crisis, and support activities prior to the crisis and after the crisis. If designed with gaming in mind, those same CMSs could be easily used in a simulation mode to play a crisis management game. Such a use of the system would also provide personnel with opportunities to rehearse for real crises using the same tools they would have available to them in a real crisis. In this paper, we provide some background for the use of simulation and gaming in crisis management training, describe an architecture for simulation and gaming, and present a case study to illustrate how virtual environments can be used for crisis management training.

The coordination strategies used by the teams were evaluated by applying coordination process indicators and the concept of control. The paper discusses how different aspects of team coordination in unexpected and escalating situations, e.g. that teams that maintain a high level of control in escalating situations, avoid or minimize the effects of data overload by using explicit and agreed-upon goals rather than sharing as much incoming information as possible. The results presented in this paper show the benefits of applying a broad set of theoretical concepts to shed light on the actual demands that escalating situations pose on people's data processing capacities and processes. It also provides guidance on the successful performance of teams in such situations and thus support for the development of successful strategies for their management.

In this paper we analyze the process of crisis communication, characteristics of known reactive crisis communications strategies and examine if there are differences in attitudes towards reactive communication strategies among future business professional. In order to so, we use two samples of undergraduate seniors at the University of Zagreb: business school students and public relations students. Namely, in the future, business students will assume management positions in organizations of different types, while their colleagues studying public relations will be in a position to lead the communication of these organizations, with both groups mutually cooperating. To test the differences in tendencies towards certain reactive strategies we used a survey methodology where students were presented with hypothetical situations. By conduction a comparative analysis of their responses and tendencies to use specific strategies, our research results show that there are significant differences between the two groups. Students of public relations have a greater tendency to use active strategies compared to their counterparts studying business economics, who in turn display greater caution and passivity in their approaches. Based of our findings it can be concluded that both groups require further training and acquisition of practical experience to be able, at the highest level, to face, handle and successfully resolve crisis communication situations that were presented to them during the research.|Montenegrin Journal of Economics|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_1630 codebook WWU.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1630.pdf|http://www.mnje.com/sites/mnje.com/files/mnje_vol._9_no_2_-_spec._issue.pdf#page=27|Tipuric, D; Skoko, B; Jugo, D; Mesin, M Comments: Paper is about crisis communication in businesses, not about disaster management.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives Survey questionnaire: seven questions, each of which represented one group of reactive strategies, presented through the simulation of a crisis situation.|Survey questionnaire: seven questions, each of which represented one group of reactive strategies, presented through the simulation of a crisis situation.|Analyze the process of crisis communication, characteristics of known reactive crisis communications strategies and examine if there are differences in attitudes towards reactive communication strategies among future business professional|2 Samples of undergraduate seniors [business school students and public relations students]|Survey – comparative analysis (qualitative approach)|-|Survey methodology with 165 respondents129 students from the Faculty of Economics and Business36 students from the Faculty of Political Science|The difference in answers between the business school students and public relations students was tested using the z-test for differences in proportions in two independent samples|--|Business students, to a greater extent, chose more passive strategies and also strategies that are less risky compared to students of public relations.

Transparency (operationalized as increasing levels of explanation associated with an automated tool recommendation) was manipulated to evaluate how transparent interfaces influence pilot trust of an emergency landing planning aid. We conducted a low-fidelity study in which commercial pilots interacted with simulated recommendations from NASAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Emergency Landing Planner (ELP) that varied in their associated levels of transparency. Results indicated that trust in the ELP was influenced by the level of transparency within the humanÃ¢â‚¬â€œmachine interface of the ELP. Design recommendations for automated systems are discussed.

This study aims to clarify the psychological effects of disaster relief activities on Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) personnel following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Method: A self-report questionnaire was administered to 606 JGSDF personnel one month after completing the disaster relief mission. Posttraumatic stress responses and general psychological distress were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the K10 scales. Associations between outcome variables and independent variables (age, gender, military rank, length of deployment, and exposure to dead bodies) were measured with univariate analyses and subsequent multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: The mean (Ã‚Â± SD) IES-R score was 6.2 (Ã‚Â± 8.1), and the mean K10 score was 12.8 (Ã‚Â± 4.4). In the univariate analyses, exposure to dead bodies and age were identified as significant factors for IES-R and K10 scores, ( p < 0.01). However, the multiple logistic regression analyses did not reveal any significant factors although body handlers' exposure approached significance for IES-R. Conclusions: The subjects reported very low psychological responses despite the severe nature of their disaster relief activities. Several factors may account for the low levels of psychological distress and posttraumatic symptoms observed in this study.|Psychiatry: Interpersonal & Biological Processes|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_1632 codebook WWU.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1632.pdf|http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/pdf/10.1521/psyc.2014.77.2.190|Dobashi, K; Nagamine, M; Shigemura, J; Tsunoda, T; Shimizu, K, Yoshino, A; Nomura, S Comments: The paper examines the psychological effects of disaster relief activities, including mortuary work, on JGSDF personnel following the Great East Japan Earthquake.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives -- |-- |Clarify the psychological effects of disaster relief activities on Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) personnel following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake|Subjects were JGSDF personnel who were dispatched from the northern Kyushu district—an unaffected region—for disaster relief activities in the Minamisanriku town, Miyagi prefectures.A total of 606 personnel took part in our study.Most of the subjects were not directly affected by the disaster; however, the families of two participants were directly affected.|Questionnaire|Posttraumatic stress responses and general psychological distress were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the K10 scales|Self-report questionnaire was administered to 606 JGSDF personnel one month after completing the disaster relief missionThis study was conducted as part of a mandatory self-report health survey for all JGSDF personnel engaged in this disaster relief activity; therefore, it was an on-therecord (i.e., non-anonymous) survey, and the response rate was 100%.|Associations between outcome variables and independent variables (age, gender, military rank, length of deployment, and exposure to dead bodies) were measured with univariate analyses and subsequent multiple logistic regression analyses.|The JGSDF Fukuoka Hospital Ethics Committee approved the study protocol.| The authors did not find any factors that caused psychological distress following disaster relief activities in the multivariate analyses, our findings are consistent with previous reports that younger personnel are more vulnerable to general psychological distress and that relief workers exposed to dead bodies are prone to posttraumatic responses.|It is difficult to predict long-term outcomes from a cross-sectionaldesign.

Background: Current disaster knowledge, skills, and preparedness levels need to be evaluated to guide plans for effective educational programs. There is also a need to know where RNs received their knowledge, skills, and preparation, to enhance or improve future educational opportunities. Methods: Cross-sectional survey where the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool (DPETÃ‚Â®) was distributed to Jordanian RNs who work in three randomly selected Ministry of Health hospitals and two university hospitals. Results: Four hundred and seventy-four participants completed the survey. Sixty-five per cent of respondents described their current disaster preparedness as weak: 18% medium: 12% good; and 5% felt their preparation was very good. Thirty-one per cent received disaster education in undergraduate programs; 8% in graduate nursing programs; 31% in facility drills, and 22% in continuing education courses. Eleven per cent had participated in a real disaster. Four hundred and thirty RNs wanted to learn more about RNs role in disasters, including knowledge and skills. Conclusion: Knowledge, skills, and disaster preparedness need continual reinforcement to improve self efficacy for disaster management.

1648|A priority driven ABC approach to the emergency management of high energy pelvic trauma improves decision making in simulated patient scenarios.|Daurka, Jasvinder S. ; Rankin, Iain ; Jaggard, M.K.J. ; Lewis, Angus|2015|*PELVIC injuries;*ORTHOPEDICS;EMERGENCY medical services;MEDICAL decision making;ADVANCED trauma life support;OUTCOME assessment (Medical care);Advanced life support;Advanced trauma life support;ALS;ATLS;Orthopaedic trauma association;OTA|Introduction An ABC priority driven approach to the management of high energy pelvic injuries has been developed and applied as a teaching tool. A prospective study assessed whether trainees taught this ABC aide memoire gave better priority driven care in simulated patient scenarios. They were compared directly to colleagues undergoing the same pelvic training but without reference to the ABC concept. Methods Orthopaedic trainees were formally assessed by viva scenario upon their pelvic trauma management 6 weeks after a pelvic trauma teaching event. Trainees all received standard pelvic trauma teaching but were randomised into two groups. One group alone had an introduction to the ABC algorithm. Inclusion criteria were trainees belonging to the same deanery teaching group with similar levels of training and experience in pelvic trauma. Those completing a pelvic trauma post or teaching in pelvic trauma were excluded. Results There were 20 trainees included and three scenarios giving 60 scores. The mean year of training or the number of pelvic trauma cases experienced did not differ significantly between the groups ( p = 0.426 and p = 0.347). The ABC teaching concept yielded significant improvements in several aspects: coagulopathy assessment and management ( p = <0.001); urological injury ( p = 0.047), appropriate prioritisation ( p = 0.006) and bowel injury/open fracture assessment ( p = 0.007). A poorer response was seen in CT assessment ( p = 0.004). Discussion and conclusion The ABC priority driven approach to pelvic trauma management provides structure when decision making. This method improves clinician's recall, prioritisation and potentially clinical outcomes.

The content validity, response process, internal structure, relations with other variables and consequences were described for validity evidence. Simulated crisis management sessions were initiated during which two trained raters evaluated the performance of postgraduate first-, second- and third-year (PGY-1, PGY-2 and PGY-3) anaesthesia residents. The study included 70 participants, composed of 24 PGY-1, 24 PGY-2 and 22 PGY-3 residents. Both instruments differentiated the non-technical skills of PGY-1 from PGY-3 residents (P <0.05). Inter-rater agreement was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). For the ANTS instrument, the intraclass correlation coefficients for task management, team-working, situation awareness and decision-making were 0.79, 0.34, 0.81 and 0.70, respectively. For the Ottawa GRS, the intraclass correlation coefficients for overall performance, leadership, problem-solving, situation awareness, resource utilisation and communication skills were 0.86, 0.83, 0.84, 0.87, 0.80 and 0.86, respectively. The Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency of the ANTS instrument was 0.93, and was 0.96 for the Ottawa GRS. There was a high correlation between the ANTS and Ottawa GRS. The raters reported the ease of use of the Ottawa GRS compared to the ANTS. We found sufficient evidence of validity in the ANTS instrument and the Ottawa GRS for the evaluation of non-technical skills in a simulated anaesthesia setting, but the Ottawa GRS was more practical and had higher reliability.

DESIGN: : Self-controlled randomized crossover study design with blinded assessors. SETTING: : A simulated critical care ward, using a high-fidelity patient simulator, in a university simulation center. SUBJECTS: : Forty teams from critical care units within the region comprising one doctor and three nurses. INTERVENTION: : At the beginning and end of the 10-hr study day, each team undertook two preintervention and two postintervention assessment simulations (one airway, one cardiac on both occasions). The study day included presentations and discussions on human factors and crisis management, and airway and cardiac skills stations. For the intervention, teams were randomized to case-based learning or simulation-based learning for cardiac or airway scenarios. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: : Each simulation was recorded and independently rated by three blinded expert assessors using a structured rating tool with technical and behavioral components. Participants were surveyed 3 months later. We demonstrated significant improvements in scores for overall teamwork (p <= .002) and the two behavioral factors, 'Leadership and Team Coordination' (p <= .002) and 'Verbalizing Situational Information' (p <= .02). Scores for clinical management also improved significantly (p <= .003). We found no significant difference between simulation-based learning and case-based learning in the context of this study. Survey data supported the effectiveness of study day with responders reporting retention of learning and changes made to patient management. CONCLUSIONS: : A simulation-based study day can improve teamwork in multidisciplinary critical care unit teams as measured in pre- and postcourse simulations with some evidence of subsequent changes to patient management. In the context of a full-day course, using a mix of simulation-based learning and case-based learnings seems to be an effective teaching strategy.|Critical Care Medicine|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_1658 codebook WWU.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1658.pdf|http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/sp-3.27.1a/ovidweb.cgi?WebLinkFrameset=1&S=ELLFFPMFGKDDDAOLNCGKOBOBHGMCAA00&returnUrl=ovidweb.cgi%3f%26Full%2bText%3dL%257cS.sh.27.28%257c0%257c00003246-201112000-00003%26S%3dELLFFPMFGKDDDAOLNCGKOBOBHGMCAA00&directlink=http%3a%2f%2fovidsp.tx.ovid.com%2fovftpdfs%2fFPDDNCOBOBOLGK00%2ffs046%2fovft%2flive%2fgv025%2f00003246%2f00003246-201112000-00003.pdf&filename=The+effect+of+a+simulation-based+training+intervention+on+the+performance+of+established+critical+care+unit+teams+%2a.&pdf_key=FPDDNCOBOBOLGK00&pdf_index=/fs046/ovft/live/gv025/00003246/00003246-201112000-00003|Frengley R; Weller, J; Torrie, J; Dzendrowskyj, P; Yee, B; Paul, A; Shulruf, B; Henderson K Comments: The study supports the effectiveness of a simulation-based intervention in improving performance in multidisciplinary critical care teams and the feasibility of recruiting work-based teams from surrounding hospitals as participants.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives A simulated critical care ward, using a high-fidelity patient simulator, in a university simulation center|A simulated critical care ward, using a high-fidelity patient simulator, in a university simulation center|Evaluate the effectiveness of a simulation-based intervention on improving teamwork in multidisciplinary critical care teams managing airway and cardiac crises and compared simulation-based learning and case-based learning on scores for performance.|Self-controlled randomized crossover study design with blinded assessorsThe study day included presentations and discussions on human factors and crisis management, and airway and cardiac skills stations.

The aims of this study were to identify the non-technical skills required of surgeons in disaster response and training for disaster response and to explore the barriers and facilitators to interprofessional practice in surgical teams responding to disasters. Twenty health professionals, with prior experience in natural disaster response or education, participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews. A qualitative matrix analysis design was used to thematically analyze the data. Non-technical skills for surgeons in disaster response identified in this study included skills for austere environments, cognitive strategies and interprofessional skills. Skills for austere environments were physical self-care including survival skills, psychological self-care, flexibility, adaptability, innovation and improvisation. Cognitive strategies identified in this study were 'big picture' thinking, situational awareness, critical thinking, problem solving and creativity. Interprofessional attributes include communication, team-player, sense of humor, cultural competency and conflict resolution skills. 'Interprofessionalism' in disaster teams also emerged as a key factor in this study and incorporated elements of effective teamwork, clear leadership, role adjustment and conflict resolution. The majority of participants held the belief that surgeons needed training in non-technical skills in order to achieve best practice in disaster response. Surgeons considerring becoming involved in disaster management should be trained in these skills, and these skills should be incorporated into disaster preparation courses with an interprofessional focus.|Journal of Interprofessional Care|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_1659 codebook WWU.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1659.pdf|http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/13561820.2012.706337?needAccess=true|Willems, A; Waxman, B; Bacon, A; Smith, J; Peller, J; Kitto, S Comments: The aim of this paper was to identify inter-professional non-technical skills for surgeons in disaster response and training for disaster response and to explore the barriers and facilitators to inter-professional practice in disaster surgical  teams through a structured qualitative methodology and triangulation with the existing literature.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives  The phenomena explored within this study are interprofessional nontechnicalcompetencies for surgeons in disaster response.| The phenomena explored within this study are interprofessional nontechnicalcompetencies for surgeons in disaster response.|What are the perceptions of surgeons and other health professionals of the current and required interprofessional non-technical core competencies of surgeons in disaster management?|Prioritize a diverse professional participant pool in sampling to reflect the variety of health disciplines represented in disaster response.Health professionals were divided into four broad professional categories.|Qualitative-matrix analysis design – Thematic content analysis (TCA) and interviews|Non-technical skills for surgeons in disaster response classified in 3 categories:Austere environment skillsCognitive strategiesInterprofessional skills|Purposeful, snowball and maximum variation sampling were used to identify participants.Collection through voluntary semi-structured in-depth interviews (20 of them ranging from 45mins.

As a complement to field measurements, these tools participate in emergency decision support regarding the assessment of impacted areas and population protection countermeasures. This paper aims to study how this expertise is used during crisis situation and question the notion of 'decision support'. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted in 2012Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2013 with representatives of the French civilian protection community taking part in the emergency response. Analysis is based on a conceptual framework that assesses how individuals and group of individuals make sense and react to a situation in difficult conditions. Results suggest that if ADIAM systems are used as main emergency support tools by scientific organization to assess areas affected by the release and their potential health impact, their use as a support to civilian protection decision makers is still seeking its place regarding current organization and practices. Results suggest that the main challenge in further integration of ADIAM cartographic results to support population protection decisions needs to take into consideration efforts of the nuclear crisis organization to preserve the balance between different stakeholdersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ expertise. We argue that in this context, ADIAM cartographic results may find their place as a communication support between scientific advisors and decision makers contributing to favor a shared radiological situation assessment.

REACT was developed in partnership with public safety agencies to address the need for promoting psychological health. This resulted in the development of a program that uses train-the-trainer methodology to address primary prevention of stress injuries. REACT was an all-day training that consisted of four modules, each featuring instruction and practice. Six public safety agencies totaling 30 individuals (76.9% from four fire departments, 23.1% from two emergency communication centers) participated in REACT. The primary outcomes were knowledge and training-related self-efficacy; secondary outcomes included general self-efficacy, resilience, and improved attitudes and expectations. A peer-support model, using a train-the-trainer methodology, is a promising approach for addressing the promotion of psychological health.

1681|Crisis leadership in an acute clinical setting: christchurch hospital, new zealand ICU experience following the february 2011 earthquake.|Zhuravsky, Lev|2015|crisis; intensive care unit; leadership; shared leadership|Introduction On Tuesday, February 22, 2011, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand. This qualitative study explored the intensive care units (ICUs) staff experiences and adopted leadership approaches to manage a large-scale crisis resulting from the city-wide disaster. Problem To date, there have been a very small number of research publications to provide a comprehensive overview of crisis leadership from the perspective of multi-level interactions among staff members in the acute clinical environment during the process of the crisis management. METHODS: The research was qualitative in nature. Participants were recruited into the study through purposive sampling. A semi-structured, audio-taped, personal interview method was chosen as a single data collection method for this study. This study employed thematic analysis. RESULTS: Formal team leadership refers to the actions undertaken by a team leader to ensure the needs and goals of the team are met. Three core, formal, crisis-leadership themes were identified: decision making, ability to remain calm, and effective communication. Informal leaders are those individuals who exert significant influence over other members in the group to which they belong, although no formal authority has been assigned to them. Four core, informal, crisis-leadership themes were identified: motivation to lead, autonomy, emotional leadership, and crisis as opportunity. Shared leadership is a dynamic process among individuals in groups for which the objective is to lead one another to the achievement of group or organizational goals. Two core, shared-leadership themes were identified: shared leadership within formal medical and nursing leadership groups, and shared leadership between formal and informal leaders in the ICU. CONCLUSION: The capabilities of formal leaders all contributed to the overall management of a crisis. Informal leaders are a very cohesive group of motivated people who can make a substantial contribution and improve overall team performance in a crisis. While in many ways the research on shared leadership in a crisis is still in its early stages of development, there are some clear benefits from adopting this leadership approach in the management of complex crises. This study may be useful to the development of competency-based training programs for formal leaders, process improvements in fostering and supporting informal leaders, and it makes important contributions to a growing body of research of shared and collective leadership in crisis.

Hypothesis/Problem Little data have been collected regarding the successes and challenges of disaster preparedness-focused HCCs in augmenting health care system preparedness for disasters. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of nine HCC leaders. Transcripts were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: The commonly noted benefits of HCCs were: community-wide and regional partnership building, providing an impartial forum for capacity building, sharing of education and training opportunities, staff- and resource-sharing, incentivizing the participation of clinical partners in preparedness activities, better communication with the public, and the ability to surge. Frequently noted challenges included: stakeholder engagement, staffing, funding, rural needs, cross-border partnerships, education and training, and grant requirements. Promising practices addressed: stakeholder engagement, communicating value and purpose, simplifying processes, formalizing connections, and incentivizing participation. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening HCCs and their underlying systems could lead to improved national resilience to disasters. However, despite many successes, coalition leaders are faced with obstacles that may preclude optimal system functioning. Additional research could: provide further insight regarding the benefit of HCCs to local communities, uncover obstacles that prohibit local disaster-response capacity building, and identify opportunities for an improved system capacity to respond to, and recover from, disasters.

Methods: Thirty-seven participants completed simulation testing in a randomized study design with two visual display conditions (static and dynamic display). Outcome measures included speed and accuracy of response to situation awareness questions presented orally during three separate simulation freezes, and self-rating of performance. Results: Results indicate that the type of ERFB display significantly influenced the speed and accuracy of responses. Qualitative results indicate that situation awareness was increased when using the dynamic ERFB. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the dynamic ERFB offers an objective measure of performance and as a consequence, it is recommended that dynamic ERFBs be implemented into future offshore emergency response assessment training. Relevance to industry: Given the enormous amount of information available during an emergency, the dynamic ERFB offers an improved system for data logging, consolidation of information, and greater comprehension of relevant resource allocation factors.

1688|The Emerging Role of Higher Education in Educating and Assessing Future Leaders for Disaster Relief.|Buschlen, Eric ; Goffnett, Sean|2013|CRISIS management;TUITION tax credits;FLOOD insurance;POSTSECONDARY education;EXPERIENTIAL learning;HIGHER education;DISASTER relief|As the frequency and intensity of disasters throughout the world increase, so do the demands for humanitarian relief and the need for effective disaster-based leadership training. Numerous organizations are poised to act in response to disasters that necessitate a significant amount of leadership and logistics support. Although there are many entities often involved in disaster relief, the symposium outlines the emerging role higher education can play in improving response outcomes, not only by providing 'boots on the ground' but also by developing skilled disaster relief leaders in both curricular and cocurricular venues. Institutions of higher education provide experiential learning opportunities offering critical service for immediate disaster relief while developing the skills of future leaders. During these experiences, students develop disaster-based leadership and logistics acumen. Similarly, programmatic assessment is critical in measuring student leadership growth during the experiential learning process of providing disaster relief. The education and assessment of these trainings provides an important dimension of disaster leadership as it examines the leaders in action and fosters a commitment to adequately prepare them to lead in a time of disaster. A qualitative approach is recommended for assessing experiential leadership learning to better inform teaching and to cultivate future disaster leadership that meets ongoing global needs.

Despite this requirement, there is no direct evidence that such drills improve disaster response. Furthermore, there is no generally accepted, validated tool to evaluate hospital performance during disaster drills. We characterize the internal and interrater reliability of a hospital disaster drill performance evaluation tool developed by the Johns Hopkins University Evidence-based Practice Center, under contract from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). METHODS: We evaluated the reliability of the Johns Hopkins/AHRQ drill performance evaluation tool by applying it to multiple hospitals in Los Angeles County, CA, participating in the November 2005 California statewide disaster drill. Thirty-two fourth-year medical student observers were deployed to specific zones (incident command, triage, treatment, and decontamination) in participating hospitals. Each observer completed common tool items, as well as tool items specific to their hospital zone. Two hundred items from the tool were dichotomously coded as indicating better versus poorer preparedness. An unweighted 'raw performance' score was calculated by summing these dichotomous indicators. To quantify internal reliability, we calculated the Kuder-Richardson interitem consistency coefficient, and to assess interrater reliability, we computed the kappa coefficient for each of the 11 pairs of observers who were deployed within the same hospital and zone. RESULTS: Of 17 invited hospitals, 6 agreed to participate. The raw performance scores for the 94 common items ranged from 18 (19%) to 63 (67%) across hospitals and zones. The raw performance scores of zone-specific items ranged from 14 of 45 (31%) to 30 of 45 (67%) in the incident command zone, from 2 of 17 (12%) to 15 of 17 (88%) in the triage zone, from 19 of 26 (73%) to 22 of 26 (85%) in the treatment zone, and from 2 of 18 (11%) to 10 of 18 (56%) in the decontamination zone. The Kuder-Richardson internal reliability, by zone, ranged from 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.87) in the treatment zone to 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99) in the incident command zone. The interrater reliability ranged, across hospital zones, from 0.24 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.38) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.81) for the 11 pairs of observers. CONCLUSION: We found a high degree of internal reliability in the AHRQ instrument's items, suggesting the underlying construct of hospital preparedness is valid.

1699|The Rapid Disaster Evaluation System (RaDES): A Plan to Improve Global Disaster Response by Privatizing the Assessment Component.|Iserson, Kenneth V.|2017|disaster management;disasters;privatization;rapid disaster assessment|Background Emergency medicine personnel frequently respond to major disasters. They expect to have an effective and efficient management system to elegantly allocate available resources. Despite claims to the contrary, experience demonstrates this rarely occurs. Objectives This article describes privatizing disaster assessment using a single-purposed, accountable, and well-trained organization. The goal is to achieve elegant disaster assessment, rather than repeatedly exhorting existing groups to do it. Discussion The Rapid Disaster Evaluation System (RaDES) would quickly and efficiently assess a postdisaster population's needs. It would use an accountable nongovernmental agency's teams with maximal training, mobility, and flexibility. Designed to augment the Inter-Agency Standing Committee's 2015 Emergency Response Preparedness Plan, RaDES would provide the initial information needed to avoid haphazard and overlapping disaster responses. Rapidly deployed teams would gather information from multiple sources and continually communicate those findings to their base, which would then disseminate them to disaster coordinators in a concise, coherent, and transparent way. Conclusions The RaDES concept represents an elegant, minimally bureaucratic, and effective rapid response to major disasters. However, its implementation faces logistical, funding, and political obstacles. Developing and maintaining RaDES would require significant funding and political commitment to coordinate the numerous agencies that claim to be performing the same tasks. Although simulations can demonstrate efficacy and deficiencies, only field tests will demonstrate RaDES' power to improve interagency coordination and decrease the cost of major disaster response. At the least, the RaDES concept should serve as a model for discussing how to practicably improve our current chaotic disaster responses.

Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act of 1996|We report the results of a study designed to assess and evaluate how the law shapes the public health system's preparedness activities. Based on 144 qualitative interviews conducted in nine states, we used a model that compared the objective legal environment with how practitioners perceived the laws. Most local public health and emergency management professionals relied on what they perceived the legal environment to be rather than on an adequate understanding of the objective legal requirements. Major reasons for the gap include the lack of legal training for local practitioners and the difficulty of obtaining clarification and consistent legal advice regarding public health preparedness. Narrowing the gap would most likely improve preparedness outcomes. We conclude that there are serious deficiencies in legal preparedness that can undermine effective responses to public health emergencies. Correcting the lack of legal knowledge, coupled with eliminating delays in resolving legal issues and questions during public health emergencies, could have measurable consequences on reducing morbidity and mortality.

(2011) The effectiveness of a disaster training programme for healthcare workers in Greece. International Nursing Review 58, 341-346 Background: Recent natural disasters have made disaster training a public priority. Multiple methods of disaster preparedness training have been established in hospitals worldwide. Nevertheless, researchers have not yet discovered the most effective method for training hospital personnel in the area of disaster preparedness. Aim: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that a brief educational intervention would improve hospital staff knowledge about the hospital disaster plan and procedures. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used. The intervention group included 56 professionals and the comparison group included 35 professionals in Greece. The intervention group attended a 5-h course that addressed the basic principles of hospital disaster management. A structured questionnaire was used to estimate the participants' changes in knowledge. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-test, one-way ANOVA and chi-square test were used to analyse the data. Results: The intervention resulted in a significant improvement in knowledge. The mean score was significantly higher immediately after the intervention programme [86; standard error (SE): 2] than before (44.5; SE: 1.7) ( P < 0.001). The mean score 1 month later was significantly lower (77.2; SE: 2.3) than that immediately after the intervention programme ( P < 0.001), but significantly higher than the mean score before the intervention programme ( P < 0.001). Participants in the control group achieved a score of 40 (SE: 2.4), which was significantly lower than the scores of the intervention group after the course ( P < 0.001). Conclusion: The disaster training course had a great benefit for the participants.

This study aimed at assessing the perceived knowledge, experiences and training needs of health professionals regarding disasters, their prevention and management in Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution based cross-sectional survey was conducted on 377 health professionals taken from 9 randomly selected districts out of 18. All health professionals working at health offices, hospitals and health centers were included. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire which was developed by the investigators after reviewing the relevant literature in the field. Data were coded and entered into SPSS 20 software for cleaning and analysis. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were done. RESULTS: The majority (85.1%) of the participants were able to define the concept of disaster from various perspectives; 9.7% did not know about it at all and 5.2% could describe the concept partially or misconceived it. The majority (84.3%) agreed that disaster has direct public health consequences on humans. The main public health consequence of disaster the participants mentioned was environmental pollution (65.8%). Malaria, measles and diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 35.5%, 33.1% and 10.5% of the epidemics, respectively. Only 20.6% of the respondents were trained on disaster related topics in the last two years. The majority felt that they had poor knowledge on early warning indicators of drought (48.0%) and flood (48.0%). Simialry, 50.8%, 47.7%, 51.1% and 42.6% of the participants had poor knowledge on preparedness to drought, preparedness to flood, response to drought, response to flood. On composite scale, they generally perceived to have adequate (29.4%), moderate (32.4%) and poor (38.2%) knowledge about early warning information bout, preparedness for and response to common disasters. A vast majority (92.8%) reported that they need training on disaster preparedness, management and response. CONCLUSION: A considerable number of professionals had limited understanding about the concept of disaster and response to certain specific disasters. They also had limited opportunities for training,despite their felt needs. Therefore, training should be provided focusing on the specific gaps identified.

1714|Culpable leaders, trust, emotional exhaustion, and identification during a crisis.|Kovoor-Misra, Sarah ; Gopalakrishnan, Shanthi|2016|Leadership;Trust;Identification;Attribution;Crisis;Emotional exhaustion;2016;Crises;Emotional States;Leadership;Trust (Social Behavior);Identification;2016|Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate followersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ judgments of the culpability of their leaders and the organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s external stakeholders in causing a crisis. The authors study the differences in effects of these judgments on their trust toward their leaders, their emotional exhaustion, and their levels of organizational identification. Design/methodology/approach: Using the survey method the authors collected data from 354 individuals from an organization that filed for bankruptcy. RespondentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ comments also provided qualitative data that was used to triangulate the findings. Findings: The authors find that individualsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ judgments that their leaders were culpable led to reduced trust, increased emotional exhaustion, and contrary to expectations reduced organizational identification. Therefore, it appears that in situations of perceived leader culpability during a crisis, followers tightly couple their leaders with the organization as a whole. In contrast, their judgments that external stakeholders were culpable were associated with increased trust toward their leaders, increased organizational identification, and they had no relationship with their levels of emotional exhaustion. The analysis of the qualitative data provides some insights into their judgments and the dependent variables. Research limitations/implications: Organizational membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ judgments of culpability are important factors that should be considered in crisis management research, and in research on trust, emotional exhaustion, and organizational identification. A limitation of the study is that it is cross-sectional in nature. Therefore, future research could test the findings in a longitudinal study. Practical implications: Leaders need to understand the judgments of their followers during an organizational crisis. These judgments have implications for when and how leaders can mobilize their followers and the leadership tasks during crisis containment. Originality/value: Extant research tends to focus on the judgments of external stakeholders during a crisis. This study is one of the first to examine the effects of internal stakeholdersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ judgments of culpability for causing a crisis on their trust, emotional exhaustion, and organizational identification. Further, existing empirical studies on followersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attributions during a crisis tend to be laboratory based. The study provides empirical evidence from individuals in an actual organization in crisis.

1717|Learning crisis resource management: Practicing versus an observational role in simulation training Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a randomized controlled trial.|Lai, Anita ; Haligua, Alexis ; Dylan Bould, M. ; Everett, Tobias ; Gale, Mark ; Pigford, Ashlee-Ann ; Boet, Sylvain|2016|CRISIS management;SIMULATION methods & models;RANDOMIZED controlled trials;LEARNING;PRACTICE theory (Social sciences);Communication;Crisis resource management;Debriefing;Dyad learning;Inter-professional care;Teamwork|Aim Simulation training has been shown to be an effective way to teach crisis resource management (CRM) skills. Deliberate practice theory states that learners need to actively practice so that learning is effective. However, many residency programs have limited opportunities for learners to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“activeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ participants in simulation exercises. This study compares the effectiveness of learning CRM skills when being an active participant versus being an observer participant in simulation followed by a debriefing. Methods Participants were randomized to two groups: active or observer. Active participants managed a simulated crisis scenario (pre-test) while paired observer participants viewed the scenario via video transmission. Then, a trained instructor debriefed participants on CRM principles. On the same day, each participant individually managed another simulated crisis scenario (post-test) and completed a post-test questionnaire. Two independent, blinded raters evaluated all videos using the Ottawa Global Rating Scale (GRS). Results Thirty-nine residents were included in the analysis. Normally distributed data were analyzed using paired and unpaired t -tests. Inter-rater reliability was 0.64. Active participants significantly improved from pre-test to post-test ( P = 0.015). There was no significant difference between the post-test performance of active participants compared to observer participants ( P = 0.12). Conclusion We found that learning CRM principles was not superior when learners were active participants compared to being observers followed by debriefing. These findings challenge the deliberate practice theory claiming that learning requires active practice. Assigning residents as observers in simulation training and involving them in debriefing is still beneficial.

1718|A Socio-Physical Approach to Systemic Risk Reduction in Emergency Response and Preparedness.|Ross, William ; Gorod, Alex ; Ulieru, Mihaela|2015|EMERGENCY management;RISK;MANAGEMENT;SYSTEMIC risk (Finance);SITUATIONAL awareness;PREPAREDNESS;Accidents;Clustering coefficient;Educational institutions;emergency response and preparedness;Emergency services;Hazards;Hospitals;Risk management;risk reduction;situational awareness;socio-physical view;systemic risk|This paper proposes a socio-physical approach that considers jointly the interaction and integration of the social and physical views of a system to improve emergency response and preparedness. This is accomplished through a reduction of systemic risk, which refers to a risk that could be greater than the sum of the risks of the individual system constituents. Using network analysis, it is shown that the explicit socio-physical approach yields meaningful qualitative and quantitative differences when compared with approaches that focus on the social and physical views in isolation. The benefits of this proposed approach are illustrated on a case study using clustering analysis and a proof-of-concept simulation. This new approach leads to systemic risk reduction by enabling a more informed and coordinated response strategy following an incident and a better identification of possible consequences and preparation strategies prior to an incident.

1722|How Simple Hypothetical-Choice Experiments Can Be Utilized to Learn HumansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Navigational Escape Decisions in Emergencies.|Haghani, Milad ; Sarvi, Majid ; Shahhoseini, Zahra ; Boltes, Maik|2016|NAVIGATION;EMERGENCY management;SOCIAL interaction;BUILDING evacuation;ECONOMETRIC models;BUILT environment;Anatomy;Animal behavior;Animal migration;Animal navigation;Behavior;Biology and life sciences;Cognition;Cognitive science;Decision making;Econometrics;Economic analysis;Economics;Experimental economics;Mathematical economics;Mathematics;Medicine and health sciences;Musculoskeletal system;Neuroscience;Physical sciences;Research Article;Social sciences;Statistical data;Statistics (mathematics);Zoology|How humans resolve non-trivial tradeoffs in their navigational choices between the social interactions (e.g., the presence and movements of others) and the physical factors (e.g., spatial distances, route visibility) when escaping from threats in crowded confined spaces? The answer to this question has major implications for the planning of evacuations and the safety of mass gatherings as well as the design of built environments. Due to the challenges of collecting behavioral data from naturally-occurring evacuation settings, laboratory-based virtual-evacuation experiments have been practiced in a number of studies. This class of experiments faces the traditional question of contextual bias and generalizability: How reliably can we infer humansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ behavior from decisions made in hypothetical settings? Here, we address these questions by making a novel link between two different forms of empirical observations. We conduct hypothetical emergency exit-choice experiments framed as simple pictures, and then mimic those hypothetical scenarios in more realistic fashions through staging mock evacuation trials with actual crowds. Econometric choice models are estimated based on the observations made in both experimental contexts. The models are contrasted with each other from a number of perspectives including their predictions as well as the sign, magnitude, statistical significance, person-to-person variations (reflecting individualsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perception/preference differences) and the scale (reflecting context-dependent decision randomness) of their inferred parameters. Results reveal a surprising degree of resemblance between the models derived from the two contexts. Most strikingly, they produce fairly similar prediction probabilities whose differences average less than 10%. There is also unexpected consensus between the inferences derived from both experimental sources on many aspects of peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behavior notably in terms of the perception of social interactions. Results show that we could have elicited peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ escape strategies with fair precision without observing them in action (i.e., simply by using only hypothetical-choice data as an inexpensive, practical and non-invasive experimental technique in this context). As a broader application, this offers promising evidence as to the potential applicability of the hypothetical-decision experiments to other decision contexts (at least for non-financial decisions) when field or real-world data is prohibitively unavailable. As a practical application, the behavioral insights inferred from our observations (reflected in the estimated parameters) can improve how accurately we predict the movement patterns of human crowds in emergency scenarios arisen in complex spaces. Fully-generic-in-parameters, our proposed models can even be directly introduced to a broad range of crowd simulation software to replicate navigation decision making of evacuees.

Various yards, warehouses, distribution centers and other storage nodes are typical resource-intensive sites at which catastrophes and disasters, such as fires and chemical leakage, are prone to occur and spread. Resources are stored in block units called resource nodes. Each resource node is represented by an agent in an MAS. A resource network (network of resource storage nodes) is formed from the disaster spread relationships among resource nodes. Disaster spread simulation and rescue time analysis in resource networks are key problems in disaster prevention and relief. Based on the principles of disaster spread in resource networks, a property model of resource nodes is proposed that incorporates the values of the resources, the disastrous energy of each node, the disaster spread path, and the disaster spread characteristics. To study the dynamics of disaster spread, a state diagram is used to construct a microscopic behavior model for the resource nodes by regarding the resource nodes as agents. Then, decision models are gradually constructed to determine the optimal times for disaster rescue and emergency resource preparation. The proposed models are demonstrated using a multi-layer simulation system.

(2011) A survey of the practice of nurses' skills in Wenchuan earthquake disaster sites: implications for disaster training. Journal of Advanced Nursing 67(9), 2231-2238. Abstract Aims. To determine nursing skills most relevant for nurses participating in disaster response medical teams; make recommendations to enhance training of nurses who will be first responders to a disaster site; to improve the capacity of nurses to prepare and respond to severe natural disasters. Background. Worldwide, nurses play a key role in disaster response teams at disaster sites. They are often not prepared for the challenges of dealing with mass casualties; little research exists into what basic nursing skills are required by nurses who are first responders to a disaster situation. This study assessed the most relevant disaster nursing skills of first responder nurses at the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake disaster site. Method. Data were collected in China in 2008 using a self-designed questionnaire, with 24 participants who had been part of the medical teams that were dispatched to the disaster sites. Findings. The top three skills essential for nurses were: intravenous insertion; observation and monitoring; mass casualty triage. The three most frequently used skills were: debridement and dressing; observation and monitoring; intravenous insertion. The three skills performed most proficiently were: intravenous insertion; observation and monitoring; urethral catheterization. The top three ranking skills most important for training were: mass casualty transportation; emergency management; haemostasis, bandaging, fixation, manual handling. Conclusion. The core nursing skills for disaster response training are: mass casualty transportation; emergency management; haemostasis, bandaging, fixation, manual handling; observation and monitoring; mass casualty triage; controlling specific infection; psychological crisis intervention; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; debridement and dressing; central venous catheter insertion; patient care recording.|Journal of Advanced Nursing|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_1727 codebook WWU.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1727.pdf|http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05699.x/epdf|"Yin, H; He, H; Arbon, P; Zhu, J; Comments: 	The core of disaster management training should be mass casualty transportation; emergency management; haemostasis, bandaging, fixation, and manual handling; observation andmonitoring; mass casualty triage [most important ones].CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives "|The aim of the survey was to explore the practice of nurses’ basic care skills when they were deployed as part of first responder teams to the disaster site; identify their training needs; give information for disaster preparedness and response training.|Determine nursing skills most relevant for nurses participating in disaster response medical teamsMake recommendations to enhance training of nurses who will be first responders to a disaster siteImprove the capacity of nurses to prepare and respond to severe natural disasters|Before developing the questionnaire, two focus groups were conducted,each with eight nurses who had participated in the rescue operation following the Wenchuan earthquake disaster.

Where intramuscular injections are not available, children under 6 years may be administered a single dose of rectal artesunate. Although the current malaria treatment guidelines in Ethiopia recommend intra-rectal artesunate or alternatively intramuscular artemether or intramuscular quinine as pre-referral treatment for severe malaria at the health posts, there are currently no WHO prequalified suppliers of intra-rectal artesunate and when available, its use is limited to children under 6 years of age leaving a gap for the older age groups. Intramuscular artesunate is not part of the drugs recommended for pre-referral treatment in Ethiopia. This study assessed the perspectives of health workers, and policy-makers on the use of intramuscular artesunate as a pre-referral and definitive treatment for severe malaria at the health post level. Methods: In-depth interviews were held with 101 individuals including health workers, malaria focal persons, and Regional Health Bureaus from Oromia and southern nations, nationalities, and peoples' region, as well as participants from the Federal Ministry of Health and development partners. An interview guide was used in the data collection and thematic content analysis was employed for analysis. Results: Key findings from this study are: (1) provision of intramuscular artesunate as pre-referral and definitive treatment for severe malaria at health posts could be lifesaving; (2) with adequate training, and provision of facilities including beds, health posts can provide definitive treatment for severe malaria using intramuscular artesunate where referral is delayed or not possible; (3) health workers at health centres and hospitals frequently use the intravenous route because it allows for co-administration of other drugs, but they find the intramuscular route easier to use at the health post level; (4) the reasons commonly cited against the management of severe malaria using intramuscular artesunate at health post level were: lack of capacity to manage complications and fear of irrational drug use; (5) use of intramuscular artesunate at health post level will require evidence on safety and feasibility before policy shift. Conclusion: From the perspective of health workers, use of intramuscular artesunate as pre-referral treatment of severe malaria cases at the health post is possible but dependent on training and availability of skilled workers. Use of intramuscular artesunate as definitive treatment at health posts was not supported, however, operational research to establish its feasibility, safety and efficacy was recommended to guide any implementation of such an intervention.

In response to Joint Commission requirements, medical centers should have established protocols in place to respond to such events. We examined a full-scale regional exercise (FSRE) to identify gaps in logistics and operations during a simulated mass casualty incident. METHODS: A multiagency, multijurisdictional, multidisciplinary exercise (FSRE) included 16 area hospitals and one American College of Surgeons-verified Level I trauma center (TC). The scenario simulated a train derailment and chemical spill 20 miles from the TC using 281 moulaged volunteers. Third-party contracted evaluators assessed each hospital in five areas: communications, command structure, decontamination, staffing, and patient tracking. Further analysis examined logistic and operational deficiencies. RESULTS: None of the 16 hospitals were compliant in all five areas. Mean hospital compliance was 1.9 (Ã‚Â±0.9 SD) areas. One hospital, unable to participate because of an air conditioner outage, was deemed 0% compliant. The most common deficiency was communications (15 of 16 hospitals [94%]; State Medical Asset Resource Tracking Tool system deficiencies, lack of working knowledge of Voice Interoperability Plan for Emergency Responders radio system) followed by deficient decontamination in 12 (75%). Other deficiencies included inadequate staffing based on predetermined protocols in 10 hospitals (63%), suboptimal command structure in 9 (56%), and patient tracking deficiencies in 5 (31%). An additional 11 operational and 5 logistic failures were identified. The TC showed an appropriate command structure but was deficient in four of five categories, with understaffing and a decontamination leak into the emergency department, which required diversion of 70 patients. CONCLUSION: Communication remains a significant gap in the mass casualty scenario 10 years after 9/11. Our findings demonstrate that tabletop exercises are inadequate to expose operational and logistic gaps in disaster response. FSREs should be routinely performed to adequately prepare for catastrophic events.|Journal of Trauma & Acute Care Surgery|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_1764 codebook WWU.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1764.pdf|http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/sp-3.27.1a/ovidweb.cgi?WebLinkFrameset=1&S=ELLFFPMFGKDDDAOLNCGKOBOBHGMCAA00&returnUrl=ovidweb.cgi%3f%26Full%2bText%3dL%257cS.sh.32.33%257c0%257c01586154-201209000-00009%26S%3dELLFFPMFGKDDDAOLNCGKOBOBHGMCAA00&directlink=http%3a%2f%2fovidsp.tx.ovid.com%2fovftpdfs%2fFPDDNCOBOBOLGK00%2ffs047%2fovft%2flive%2fgv031%2f01586154%2f01586154-201209000-00009.pdf&filename=Full-scale+regional+exercises%3a++Closing+the+gaps+in+disaster+preparedness.&pdf_key=FPDDNCOBOBOLGK00&pdf_index=/fs047/ovft/live/gv031/01586154/01586154-201209000-00009|Klima, D; Seiler, S; Peterson, J Christmas, B; Green, J; Fleming, Greg; … Comments: Communication remains a significant gap in the mass casualty scenario 10 years after 9/11.

Studying critical infrastructure interdependencies (CII) is a relatively new facet of disaster risk reduction. Computer simulation software is the most effective and economical method of studying these relationships. This paper contextualises the role of CII simulation as part of a complete disaster and emergency management programme, and reviews the state-of-the-art as pertains to utilisation of such tools among Caribbean emergency management agencies (EMAs). It finds that Caribbean EMAs do not currently utilise CII tools. The paper then reviews some of the most popular simulation tools under development such as CIPDSS, HAZUS, I2Sim/DR-NEP and ESRI Sim Disaster. Their applicability and ease of adoption to the Caribbean context is considered. I2Sim was viewed as being the best suited for Caribbean EMAs.

For Australians, the impact of disasters closer to our shores has been felt through such incidents as the Bali bombings (2002 and 2005) and the Boxing Day Tsunami (2004). Significant events that have occurred on Australian soil include Cyclone Tracey (1974), the Granville Rail disaster (1977) and Ash Wednesday bushfires (1983). Natural disasters such as flooding, cyclones and bushfires continue to impact Australian communities. However, to date Australia has avoided a large scale disaster event that has overwhelmed the health care system. A mixed method approach underpins this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data was collected through a self report questionnaire. Quantitative data has provided statistic evidence to support the findings, while the qualitative data has allowed for a richer understanding of nursesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perceptions. The population for this study is South Australian emergency nurses working in public hospital emergency departments in metropolitan Adelaide. Three key themes emerged from the data. Firstly, South Australian emergency nurses have had minimal previous disaster experience (either through a real event or simulated exercises). Second, although a large number of nurses have completed what they perceive to be disaster education and training, questions were raised regarding the appropriateness, relevance and availability of such education. Third, South Australian emergency nurses have a low level of disaster knowledge. The findings from this study are relevant not only for emergency nurses, but for all health professionals involved in disaster response. In particular for those who have had minimal disaster response experience and limited exposure to disaster education and training opportunities. This study suggests a disaster training program for South Australian emergency nurses would be beneficial. The need for future research into appropriate disaster education and training for health professionals is highlighted by the study.|Australasian Emergency Nursing Journal|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_1815 codebook WWU.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1815.pdf|https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1574626710004349/1-s2.0-S1574626710004349-main.pdf?_tid=853f59ca-c0a4-11e7-8eaf-00000aacb362&acdnat=1509720030_ec83045fc8d9bf4f016aaa7876bcb2ed|Hammad, K; Arbon, P; Gebbi, K; Comments: This study was conducted with the aim of enhancing the current body of knowledge regarding emergency nurses and disaster response.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives This study was conducted with the aim of enhancing the|This study was conducted with the aim of enhancing thecurrent body of knowledge regarding emergency nurses anddisaster response.

In such a scenario, it is important to allocate emergency response units in a fair manner based on the criticality of the crisis events and their requests. In this research, a crisis management tool is developed which incorporates a resource allocation algorithm. The problem is formulated as a game-theoretic framework in which the crisis events are modeled as the players, the emergency response centers as the resource locations with emergency units to be scheduled, and the possible allocations as strategies. The payoff is modeled as a function of the criticality of the event and the anticipated response times. The game is played assuming a specific region within a certain locality of the crisis events to derive an optimal allocation. If a solution is not feasible, the perimeter of the locality in consideration is increased and the game is repeated until convergence. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology and metrics are derived to quantify the fairness of the solution. A regression analysis is performed to establish the statistical significance of the results.

In this project we aimed to identify public health issues arising from the physical and mental health symptoms suffered by the soldier volunteers deployed in an emergency relief task during the Wenchuan earthquake. Health problems identified in other emergency volunteer populations guided the development of a questionnaire. A cohort of 1,187 soldier volunteers completed the questionnaire, which measured physical and mental health symptoms during their rescue mission. The results were compared with a population norm of soldiers, although baseline data of the respondents were unavailable. Half the respondents reported suffering from skin and mucous membrane problems, followed by respiratory symptoms (38%), digestive (29%) and nervous (22%) symptoms. Despite a low response rate (53%) to the mental health component, nearly half (49%) of those who did respond reported mental health problems. The incidence of the above symptoms were significantly higher than the general soldier population. Health complaints were common in the soldiers, who had not received any formal training in rescue operations. Non-professional rescue workers who are not appropriately prepared for the role may suffer more than their professional counterparts. Attention needs to be paid to the health and safety of non-professional rescue workers, which has been ignored in most disaster management plans. These findings can be used to enhance the understanding of emergency response programs within and outside China, where this particular disaster occurred.

The following presents updated recommendations on these planning efforts. Previously published literature, project deliverables, and meeting documents for the period of 2009-2010 were reviewed. A numerical simulation was designed to evaluate the triage algorithm developed for this plan. A new, secondary triage scoring algorithm, based on co-morbidities and predicted outcomes, was created to prioritize multiple patients within a given acuity and predicted survivability cohort. Recommendations for a centralized patient and resource tracking database, plan operations, activation thresholds, mass triage, communications, data flow, staffing, resource utilization, provider indemnification, and stakeholder roles and responsibilities were specified. Educational modules for prehospital providers and nonburn center nurses and physicians who would provide interim care to burn injured disaster victims were created and pilot tested. These updated best practice recommendations provide a strong foundation for further planning efforts, and as of February 2011, serve as the frame work for the NYC Burn Surge Response Plan that has been incorporated into the New York State Burn Plan.|Journal of Burn Care & Research|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_1826 codebook WWU.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1826.pdf|http://journals.lww.com/burncareresearch/Abstract/2012/09000/Burn_Disaster_Response_Planning_in_New_York_City__.3.aspx|Yurt, R; Lazar, E; Leahy, N; Cagliuso, N; Comments: It is anticipated that the creation and activation of a regional burn disaster response plan will benefit patient care and resource use.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives The overarching goal of the guidelines was to outline a disaster response that allows for large numbers of burn injured victims to be cared for 3 to 5 days after|The overarching goal of the guidelines was to outline a disaster response that allows for large numbers of burn injured victims to be cared for 3 to 5 days afteran event until such time that tertiary burn care can be secured or the patient is safe for discharge with appropriate follow-up outpatient care.|Describe a draft response plan for the tiered triage, treatment, or transportation of 400 adult and pediatric victims (50/million population) of a burn disaster for the first 3 to 5 days after injury using regional resources. |Creation of a working group, monthly meetingsDevelopment of recommendations for best practices required coordinatedinvolvement of hospitals, government agencies and other health care institutions|Working group review  guidelines (qualitative)|Hierarchical BDRH matrix with modified guidelines|--|Review of meeting minutes and the 11 deliverables of the draft response plan was performed|--|Existing burn center referral guidelines were modified into a hierarchical BDRH matrix, which would vector certain patients to local or regional burn centers for initial care until capacity is reached.|Operational feasibility of these guidelines has not yet been tested nor established||

In response to this gap, an interprofessional course in disaster management was developed, implemented and evaluated in Toronto, Canada from 2007 to 2008. Undergraduate students from five educational institutions in nursing, medicine, paramedicine, police, media and health administration programs took an eight-week online course. The course was highly interactive and included video, a discussion forum, an online board game and opportunity to participate in a high fidelity disaster simulation with professional staff. Curriculum developers set interprofessional competency as a major course outcome and this concept guided every aspect of content and activity development. A study was conducted to examine change in students' perceptions of disaster management competency and interprofessional attitudes after the course was completed. Results indicate that the course helped students master basic disaster management content and raised their awareness of, and appreciation for, other members of the interdisciplinary team.

OBJECTIVE: To develop an observational tool that captures operating room (OR) nurses' technical skill and can be used for assessment and training. METHODS: The Imperial College Assessment of Technical Skills for Nurses (ICATS-N) assesses (i) gowning and gloving, (ii) setting up instrumentation, (iii) draping, and (iv) maintaining sterility. Three to five observable behaviours have been identified for each skill and are rated on 1-6 scales. Feasibility and aspects of reliability and validity were assessed in 20 simulation-based crisis management training modules for trainee nurses and doctors, carried out in a Simulated Operating Room. RESULTS: The tool was feasible to use in the context of simulation-based training. Satisfactory reliability (Cronbach alpha) was obtained across trainers' and trainees' scores (analysed jointly and separately). Moreover, trainer nurse's ratings of the four skills correlated positively, thus indicating adequate content validity. Trainer's and trainees' ratings did not correlate. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of OR nurses' technical skill is becoming a training priority.

Understanding reasons for nonadherence to crisis guidelines is needed to improve crisis management. We identified and measured barriers and conditions for optimal adherence as perceived by 4 categories of health care professionals. Methods: In-depth interviews were performed (n = 26) to develop a questionnaire for a cross-sectional survey of microbiologists (100% response), infection preventionists (74% response), public health physicians (96% response), and public health nurses (82% response). The groups were asked to appraise barriers encountered during 4 outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Clostridium difficile ribotype 027, rubella, and avian influenza) according to a 5-point Likert scale. When at least 33% of the participants responded Ã¢â‚¬Å“strongly agree,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“agree,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“rather agree than disagree,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a barrier was defined as Ã¢â‚¬Å“often experienced.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The common (Ã¢â‚¬Å“genericÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) barriers were included in a univariate and multivariate model. Barriers specific to the various groups were studied as well. Results: Crisis guidelines were found to have 4 generic barriers to adherence: (1) lack of imperative or precise wording, (2) lack of easily identifiable instructions specific to each profession, (3) lack of concrete performance targets, and (4) lack of timely and adequate guidance on personal protective equipment and other safety measures. The cross-sectional study also yielded profession-specific sets of often-experienced barriers. Conclusion: To improve adherence to crisis guidelines, the generic barriers should be addressed when developing guidelines, irrespective of the infectious agent. Profession-specific barriers require profession-specific strategies to change attitudes, ensure organizational facilities, and provide an adequate setting for crisis management.|American Journal of Infection Control|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/SRL_1874 codebook WWU.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1874.pdf|https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0196655310004542/1-s2.0-S0196655310004542-main.pdf?_tid=24dc37dc-c0a5-11e7-a0a6-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1509720305_f28a1406b83ddc126997b1f8c775b90a|Comments: Profession-specific barriers require profession-specific strategies to change attitudes, ensure organizational facilities, and provide an adequate setting for crisis management.

The empirical case is a hostage drama that occurred in a small Swedish town. Although staff at the local prison were situationally prepared and trained in incident exercises, two inmates with knives fled the prison after taking a warden hostage. Design/methodology/approach: A grounded theory approach was used. In all, 14 informants from four Swedish authorities were interviewed on the basis of their involvement in the hostage drama. Findings: According to the analysis, an emergency response leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotion management is framed by an organizationally embedded emotional regime which is summed up in two core themes: focus on the task and do not let emotions interfere; and provide the task force with maximum physical and psychological security. The leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotion management within this framework consists of two interdependent processes, one more organization oriented and one more individual oriented. Research limitations/implications: Small sample, lack of representativeness, and lack of illumination of possible gender-related aspects. Practical implications: The suggested model may be valuable in educational settings. Originality/value: A new integrative, theoretical process model of leadership and emotion management in complex, stressful operations.

Communication between these groups and the local populations receiving medical care is problematic in that sufficient numbers of capable translators are often unavailable or vastly undertrained with respect to medical terminology and practice. In addition, should Pacific Partnership respond to a real disaster, adequate numbers of translators will likely be unavailable as a result of the disaster itself. Consequently, medical providers will require alternate methods of communication previously tested for efficacy and validity. One such method is the use of pictograms designed to represent common medical maladies. To determine whether pictograms meet the 85% congruence level required by the American National Standards Institute, 36 images were provided to English-speaking physician assistants and nurse practitioners for interpretation with three images repeated within the array to assess internal validity of the questionnaire. Of the 33 distinct images, 26 (79%) reached 85% congruence showing that validated images may be a method of communication in circumstances where medical providers and patients speak discordant languages.|Military Medicine|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/1882-SRL_LL codebook.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1882.pdf|http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=73918226&S=R&D=aph&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50SeprE4zOX0OLCmr0%2Bep65Ssqm4SK6WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGssE61pq5PuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|Military Medicine 177, 3:291, 2012Terri H.

This paper is a report of a study conducted to translate the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation ToolÃ‚Â© into Arabic and to determine its psychometric properties, including reliability, validity and factorial structure. Background. Worldwide numbers of natural and man-made disasters have greatly increased in recent years. Since disaster strikes without warning, all healthcare providers, especially nurses, must be prepared with appropriate skills and resources for disaster procedures and management during the three phases of disaster: pre disaster, during disaster and post disaster. Knowledge levels need to be evaluated to plan effective educational programmes. Methods. The Disaster Preparedness Evaluation ToolÃ‚Â© was translated into Classical Arabic using Beaton's guideline for translation and validated by experts and a pilot study with 20 Registered Nurses from the target population. Data were collected in 2008 using self-administered questionnaires from 474 (79% return rate) Jordanian Registered Nurses who worked in randomly selected Ministry of Health hospitals and two university hospitals. Results. Principal component analysis (Promax rotation with Kaiser Normalization procedure, SPSSÃ‚Â© version 15) was used to determined construct validity, and three factors explained 64% of the variance: knowledge, skills and post disaster management. Cronbach's alpha was 0Ã‚Â·90, which demonstrated internal consistency. Conclusion. These results support the reliability and validity of the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation ToolÃ‚Â© as a measure of knowledge, skills and post disaster management. It can be used with confidence with an Arabic-speaking nursing population to measure their preparedness for disasters.

This study aims to review the effectiveness of simulation-based CRM training for interprofessional and interdisciplinary teams compared to other instructional methods (e.g., didactics). Interprofessional teams are composed of several professions (e.g., nurse, physician, midwife) while interdisciplinary teams are composed of several disciplines from the same profession (e.g., cardiologist, anaesthesiologist, orthopaedist). Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ERIC were searched using terms related to CRM, crisis management, crew resource management, teamwork, and simulation. Trials comparing simulation-based CRM team training versus any other methods of education were included. The educational interventions involved interprofessional or interdisciplinary healthcare teams. The initial search identified 7456 publications; 12 studies were included. Simulation-based CRM team training was associated with significant improvements in CRM skill acquisition in all but two studies when compared to didactic case-based CRM training or simulation without CRM training. Of the 12 included studies, one showed significant improvements in team behaviours in the workplace, while two studies demonstrated sustained reductions in adverse patient outcomes after a single simulation-based CRM team intervention. In conclusion, CRM simulation-based training for interprofessional and interdisciplinary teams show promise in teaching CRM in the simulator when compared to didactic case-based CRM education or simulation without CRM teaching. More research, however, is required to demonstrate transfer of learning to workplaces and potential impact on patient outcomes.

This is available from the corresponding author upon request.Eligibility criteria: Studies comparing simulation-based education versus any other method of education were eligible for inclusion. The education intervention included CRM in emergency or high-stakes situations involving a team (at least two individuals from different disciplines/professions). Single learner interventions were excluded. Team training encompassed both interprofessional or interdisciplinary education. The former was defined as two or more professions (e.g. a nurse and a physician) who learn with, from, and about each other, to improve collaboration, the quality of care, or both. The latter was defined as any team of health practitioners from the same profession but from two or more clinical specialties (e.g. two physicians, one nephrologist and another cardiologist). Interventions that did not explicitly mention the terms ‘‘CRM’’ or ‘‘crew resource management’’ as interventions, but taught communication and team coordination abilities during a clinical crisis were also included. Studies were only considered for inclusion if they were published in a language understood by the study team.|The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) Statement was used to guide the reporting of this review||Data sources: A librarian (L. P.) searched the electronic databases including Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ERIC on 4 September 2012. There were no restrictions on publication year. For each database, the following search terms were used: crisis resource management, crisis management, crew resource management, teamwork, and simulation.|The titles and abstracts of identified citations were divided among paired authors who independently screened the citations for compliance with the eligibility criteria. Disagreements about eligibility were recorded and resolved by consensus. Two authors independently screened the full-text articles for eligibility. Disagreements about eligibility were recorded and resolved by consensus or the involvement of another team member.||This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of inter-professional and interdisciplinary simulation-based CRM team training compared to any other education intervention. All but one of the included inter-professional and interdisciplinary studies found significant improvements in at least one of the learning outcomes when using simulation-based CRM team training compared to alternate forms of training, such as didactic teaching or case-based learning. The only inter-professional study that did not show any difference in learning outcome had a very small sample size (n¼4) (Shapiro et al., 2004), which resulted in a lack of statistical power. No studies reported outcomes that were worse in the simulation-based CRM training group compared to any comparator group. We conclude that CRM simulation-based training for inter-professional and interdisciplinary teams shows promise as a superior training method over traditional non-simulation clinical teaching of CRM principals.Despite correlations between clinical and team coordination abilities for individual CRM simulation training (Riem, Boet, Bould, Tavares, & Naik, 2012), this review found limited evidence to support the benefit of additional team-based simulation CRM teaching on enhancing clinical knowledge or skills. Clinical performance improved for pre- to post-intervention scores, but teams that received additional instruction on CRM teaching (Crofts et al., 2007; Ellis et al., 2008; Jankouskas et al., 2011), or added simulation to an existing didactic-based CRM intervention (Daniels et al., 2010), fared no better than those that did not. Only one study showed improved team clinical knowledge or skills with additional team training (Thomas et al., 2010). One possibility was that clinical knowledge or skill development was a general effect of rehearsal and CRM teaching posed no additional benefit to learning. Simulation-based CRM team training, however, showed significant and reproducible improvements in CRM communication and team coordination abilities, (Daniels et al., 2010; Frengley et al., 2011; Jankouskas et al., 2011; Siassakos et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2007, 2010), which suggests the benefits seen in patient outcomes found in other studies (Phipps et al., 2012; Riley et al., 2011) were a function of specific communication and TEAM coordination abilities for CRM learned rather than clinical knowledge or skills, but more evidence is needed to affirm this.The retention of CRM skills across the Kirkpatrick levels was inconsistent and remains unclear. Retention of CRM skills was seen up to 6 months in a simulated environment (Thomas et al., 2010), which was consistent with previous work published on non-team based interventions (Naik, Savoldelli, Joo, Chandra, & Weiss, 2007). At higher levels of learning, however, retention of CRM skills were only seen for up to 1 week when measured in the workplace (Miller et al., 2012). Possible reasons for this includes study design, other confounding variables affecting retention in real-life settings, or more simulation-based training may be needed for skill retention in the workplace compared to the simulator. This was further complicated by other studies that showed retention at even higher Kirkpatrick levels, (i.e. patient benefits), that lasted as long as 18–24 months after a single simulation-based CRM team training intervention. Possible confounders were not assessed in these studies. Therefore, it is also unclear why a simulation-based team intervention might improve patient outcomes longer than measurable workplace performances in CRM reported in other studies and warrants further investigation.This review reports on 12 studies measuring learning outcomes after simulation-based CRM training for inter-professional and interdisciplinary teams of learners. Although positive outcomes were reported in all but two studies (Crofts et al., 2008; Ellis et al., 2008; Shapiro et al., 2004), generalizable conclusions cannot be reached due to the variety of learning interventions, methodologies, and outcome measurements. This review, however, demonstrates promise for the use of simulation-based CRM team training to enhance the acquisition of communication and coordination abilities for crises management, although there is still a need to align research practices and identify best practices.|Future efforts should involve rigorous methodology, standardized learning interventions, and validated measurement tools. Areas of focus should emphasize knowledge translation into workplaces or effects on patients’ outcome (Kirkpatrick 3 and 4) or study designs that elucidate the most effective and efficient means by which simulation-based CRM training is delivered (how often and with whom). The latter should also involve a systematic analysis of return on investment, which may aid in increased accessibility to simulation training. Importantly, this review also highlights some challenges that prevail in CRM research. As noted by Salas, Rhodenizer, and Bowers (2000), CRM suffers from ‘‘definitional ambiguity’’ where no universal definition of CRM exists.||

Design/methodology/approach: Since little empirical research exists on leadership styles within multi-agency systems, particularly those focussed on disaster management, this exploratory study relied on a qualitative research design. In-depth interviews with the networkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s participants allowed for a better understanding of group dynamics and membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ leadership approaches.

The findings also underscored the need for a combination of transactional and transformational leadership in a disaster management context. Research limitations/implications: Although qualitative methods do not afford generalizability beyond the case study, they do provide depth of knowledge of an under-researched phenomenon and indicate a need for future comparative case studies and longitudinal research on cross-sector disaster management systems and leadership issues. Originality/value: As one of the first studies to chart leadership styles that collaborative members practice in such networks in the Caribbean, this research contributes to scholarship on networks in general and leadership within disaster management networks in particular.

What leadership styles are manifest within a cross-sector NDMN in the Caribbean?RQ2. When do members employ certain leadership styles during the disaster management cycle?|Primary data were then collected from elite interviews with 25 individuals participating in the NDMN. Working with the network coordinator, every member was contacted via telephone and e-mail to schedule an interview.|Exploratory study based on a qualitative research design: in depth interviews ||Respondents included senior-level officers from government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and businesses as well as private citizens considered leaders in their community. All interviews were conducted in the participants’ offices to reduce the distance between the investigator and those being studied (Creswell, 1998). These face-to-face meetings, which ranged in length from 30 to 120 minutes, provided an opportunity to witness physical reactions that led to probing questions to capture the depth of the interviewees’ experiences, gather detailed examples, and clarify unclear statements. The interview guide consisted of semi-structured, open-ended questions in order to gain a better understanding of the intricacy of the case. Its set of predetermined questions, which were created based on the literature and document analysis, ensured consistency in the information gathered from each participant. Some examples were: how are decisions made regarding the strategic direction for and critical tasks of the NDMN? Which members do you consider leaders within the NDMN? How and when did they become leaders? What skills and behaviors do those in leadership positions display that help and/or hinder the NDMN’s progress?An analytical memorandum was prepared after completing each interview and used to reflect upon emerging ideas and any disagreements and relationships among those ideas generated from the questioning (Maxwell, 1996). These memoranda aided in highlighting unexpected information, updating codes, and determining next steps. Therefore, they served as an ongoing means of data assessment.|A review of the interview transcriptions, analytical memoranda, meeting notes, and document summary forms. Connections and major issues emerging from this examination were linked back to the research questions. Data triangulation occurred to enhance the likelihood of capturing patterns and themes. In addition to triangulation, credibility checkpoints that served to enhance the study’s validity were peer debriefing and member check-in. Peer debriefing allowed subject-matter experts outside of the investigation to confirm the reliability of the research design, examine the findings, and improve coherence and clarity. Member checking offered interviewees the opportunity to assess the accuracy of accounts incorporated into the final analysis.Data analysis was built upon grounded codes. Initial coding was descriptive to help summarize information in the transcriptions and identify related data. Once “tentative ideas about categories and relationships” were developed, analytical coding commenced to solidify the categorization of codes (Maxwell, 1996). Coding continued until information no longer added meaning to the categories, which resulted in three main categories of leadership styles that surfaced within the NDMN. Constant comparison of each code took place to ensure consistency of the coding. |Importantly, anonymity was granted to the interviewees. Because the nation andNDMN have relatively small populations, someone familiar with the networkmembership possibly could identify participants based on the descriptions in theanalysis. Hence, caution has been used in reporting data considered too revealing|The analysis identified what and when certain leadership styles manifest themselves in the network based on the stages of the disaster management cycle. The findings also underscored the need for a combination of transactional and transformational leadership in a disaster management context.The vast majority of respondents offered their own definition of leadership, explained their leadership skills and behaviors, described their preferred leadership style, and commented on other participants’ approaches in the network. Based on their narratives, the NDMN exhibits a blend of three primary leadership styles: participatory, directive, and delegative. The NDMN also appears to be generating certain leadership styles based on its shifting structure throughout the disaster management cycle.A participatory leadership approach occurs predominantly in the preparedness stage. a directive leadership style pervades recovery and mitigation. This may be, in part, due to the network structure; the Coordinator is the central player and many participants expect this individual to manage the group’s tasks for these stages. In the response stage, the interviewees revealed the NDMN displays a delegative leadership style, combining transformational and transactional leadership that are crucial in a disaster management context.|Although qualitative methods do not afford generalizability beyond the case study, they do provide depth of knowledge of an under-researched phenomenon and indicate a need for future comparative case studies and longitudinal research on cross-sector disaster management systems and leadership issues.||

The first exercise is to be held without the template, after which the standard message template is to be introduced, and its effect is to be measured in the second exercise. The advantages of this setup include a sound comparison, extensive introduction of the template and fine-tuning the necessary measurements for the second exercise. The scenario for the crisis management exercise and –experiment has to fit both parties’ objectives and constraints, as mentioned above. By agreement, a flooding scenario was preferred over a nuclear scenario.The crisis management exercise took place in only a half-day. The day began with a general briefing in which the participants were welcomed, the presence of the DECIS Lab and their observers was explained to them, and the participants were given a number of instructions. Subsequently, the first (hour-and-a-half) session of the day began, followed by an intermezzo of 30 minutes to explain the standard message template to the participants, and to answer the questionnaire about the first session. The second session also took 1.5 hours, after which the participants answered the second questionnaire, received a lunch, and had a chance to discuss their experiences. The DECIS Lab observers and exercise control were debriefed separately for another two hours|Crisis management exercise, qualitative and quantitative data analysis|In the questionnaire (handed out to every participant after each session) participants were asked to reflect on: Decision support (usage of ICT means & contingency plans)Collaboration (collaboration within a team, between teams and within the entire organization)Workload (ability to perform one’s task, amount of routine)Timeliness/completeness of messages (features of used message templates: are the sender, content, urgency, etc. easily understandable?) Task execution (satisfaction with functioning of team and organization)Availability of information (acquisition of information)Situation awareness (having a continuous overview over, and insight in, the crisis situation)|The scenario concerns flooding of one the villages, Ellewoutsdijk, which occurred a number of days before the exercise takes place; the disruptive event has already happened and consequences need to be managed. In the second half of the exercise a dike of another village, Hoedekenskerke, is threatened: the more usual build-up of intensity. This construction has the advantage that the entire municipal crisis management organization is engaged immediately from the beginning of the exercise – the most constraining objective regarding scenario construction. The participants in the exercise were briefed that they formed a new shift for managing this crisis and had to start from the open actions and decisions from the previous shift. The outside world for the Gemeente Borsele was enacted by the exercise control (‘oefencel’) which used a detailed scenario to provide the participants with (prepared) stimuli and react to the participant’s actions.|Measuring the entire communication flow in reality was challenging in the context of this exercise. Our approach was two-sided: (1) the focus of the measurements lay on the quantitative gathering of all the information about the exchanged messages, and (2) in addition participants were asked to answer a (qualitative) questionnaire about their opinions on several aspects of the exercise.In the quantitative approach the interest lay in capturing the ‘sender’, ‘receiver’, ‘content of the message’, and the ‘time the message was sent and received’. The scenario was constructed such that all events were unique with respect to the combination of location, subject/topic and person/company. Approximately 783 logged communication actions were recorded during the entire duration of the exercise (3.5 hours in total), 327 in session 1 and 456 in session 2. Analysis of the resulting dataset proves to be a difficult task, first of all because the data are incomplete, which is often the case in naturalistic datasets.Questionnaires were not answered by all the participants in the exercise, and quite a few were only partially answered. As mentioned before, this is due to the fact that a number of participants found it very disturbing to be interrupted in their role and some plainly refused to take time to answer the questions. The analysis of the propositions yields trends which are relevant to our research and facilitates discussing the data with the Gemeente Borsele||In different action centers participants voiced their wish to know what other participants in the crisis organization were doing, what they were dealing with, and how the crisis was evolving. In other words they expressed the need for more ‘organization awareness’ as well as situation awareness.The experiences with this empirical research already show tangible benefits for both researchers and practitioners. The involved researchers from DECIS Lab have become acquainted with important crisis management aspects, and have become aware of real work-practices, needs and desires. The involved practitioners, especially those involved in setting up the exercise, enacting the scenario as participants, and subsequent evaluation, have gained insight on their own organization, as well as become inspired about possible future developments [4]. DECIS Lab and Gemeente Borsele both aim to continue empirical research to further their own, and their joint, interest in crisis management.|The improvement in internal communication was not as drastic as was hoped for; the introduction of the standard message template was not detrimental either. To ascertain the implications of the standard message template, another experiment is needed after proper introduction of the template. Pragmatic constraints on empirical data collection: some data cannot be collected at all, other data can be collected and is incomplete, and some data can be collected and is guaranteed to be complete. This greatly affects the possibilities for analysis including the validation of hypotheses. People involved in crisis management do not react favorable to any interruption, including the introduction of a standard message template. Ergo the combination of measuring two conditions (without and with the template) in one exercise did not yield as crisp data as desired. Do not underestimate the importance of researchers being present in the conception phase of the scenario that is to be played. The scenario is interdependent on measurements and experimental objectives. Scientific research designs can not always be realized in a practical crisis management context in which economical, logistical, political and motivational factors play a role. To choose the best directions for improvements and solutions, researchers need to investigate current working practices of those affected by these improvements and solutions. Explorative investigations are a prerequisite for establishing measurement criteria and possibilities for data collection. Although everything was done in this experimental research (naturalistic experiment) to ensure the validity of the data, the usability of the acquired data for specific purposes cannot easily be controlled, and needs to be taken into account during the analyses. Conducting grounded research during an actual crisis management exercise is challenging for more academic oriented researchers and imposes constraints on the data that can be collected. If too-detailed data is to be collected, a higher observer-to-participant ratio is needed, with the added possibility that participants become frustrated and irritated by too-detailed observations of their work. ||

This article aims to consider the critical aspects of collaborative teamwork in Emergency Departments that may have an impact on the information flow. Background: On the basis of Distributed Cognition Theory, we have assumed that cognitive outcomes in criticalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½care settings are not confined to the thoughts of isolated individuals; rather, they are better understood as properties of a distributed cognitive system across the minds of the clinical team members and across the technological artefacts. Design: We report on an exploratory ethnographic study of two Emergency Departments. Methods: Data were collected over a period of four months in 2008 via observation and interviews. Results: The results highlight a specific distribution of cognitive work between physicians and nurses. The nurse's roles as information highlighter, memory keeper and process organizer helped to ensure the information flow and to overcome some of the problems identified with the computerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½assisted communication process. Such distribution of cognitive work improved care quality, but it crossed established professional boundaries. Conclusion: As crossÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½boundary distribution of cognitive work in Emergency Departments can be perceived as role substitution, building an interprofessional working system is needed to avoid information breakdown in fastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½moving contexts. To realize an interprofessional working system, practiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½based training is required, aimed at developing a deep understanding of team cognition.

We evaluate several probabilistic measures of connectivity and expected travel time/distance between critical origin-destination pairs to assess the functionality of a given transportation network in case of a disaster. The input data include the most likely disaster scenarios as well as the probability that each link of the network fails under each scenario. Unlike most studies that assume independent link failures, we model dependency among link failures and propose a novel dependency model that incorporates the impact of the disaster on the network and at the same time yields tractable cases for the computation of the probabilistic measures. We develop algorithms for the computation of the measures and utilize a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm for the intractable cases. We present a case study of the Istanbul highway system under earthquake risk, and compare different dependency structures computationally.

During the response and recovery phases, considerable shortcomings were discovered. The dire situation in the affected area, a variety of urgently required interventions, and the large number of aid organizations involved brought about difficulties in management, coordination, and communication among authorities and aid organizations. This article highlights flaws in management in the various aspects of this disaster in order to assess what was done, and what should be done to overcome these shortcomings in future disasters.Methods: A retrospective review of the various aspects of management related to the Bam disaster was done via the assessment of files, multi-center studies, governmental data, and available literature from 2003-2008.Results: A review of the available data relevant to search and rescue (S&R) operations and short-term aid provision revealed flaws in different aspects of disaster management including personnel, the transfer of the injured, availability medical supplies, treatment planning, problems concerning the composition of treatment forces dispatched to the region, distribution of tasks among treatment workers, transferring of equipment, availability of facilities, and lack of coordination among the organizations responsible for the management of the disaster. Most of the aforementioned issues have been addressed.Conclusions: A comprehensive disaster management plan must not be limited only to the response phase, but rather must include: preparedness, recovery with optimal legislation and budgeting, improvement of health care facilities, and organized communication channels between the different governmental departments. This important issue has been addressed, and a disaster management organization under the supervision of the President has been established, developing a national S&R strategy and protocol for unified managerial organization, an alert system, an international disaster command system (under which S&R and emergency medical service teams can be deployed, increasing the efficacy and coordination of the arrival of foreign teams and the construction field hospitals), and developing a flowchart to coordinate international agencies and the domestic authorities in charge. Continuous education, training of the general population, conducting periodic exercise drills, and provision for prepared task force mobilization in disaster management all are important aspects of the management of disasters due to natural hazards.|Prehospital & Disaster Medicine|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\all/1949.docx|L:\Alle\Hiwis\Felix\Literature Review\PDFs\Paper/1949.pdf|https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammad_Motamedi2/publication/40909142_Motamedi_MH_Saghafinia_M_Bararani_AH_Panahi_F_A_reassessment_and_review_of_the_Bam_earthquake_five_years_onward_What_was_done_wrong/links/0fcfd506570d7162c4000000/Motamedi-MH-Saghafinia-M-Bararani-AH-Panahi-F-A-reassessment-and-review-of-the-Bam-earthquake-five-years-onward-What-was-done-wrong.pdf?_iepl%5BhomeFeedViewId%5D=2L1fnQEOUIeqFxYAoiDeMuZdYxfFgb3UpONx&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=pcfhf&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationDownload&origin=publication_detail&ev=pub_int_prw_xdl&msrp=6p2SDCgNkYpVaeXKp7jKUYjwlfYrCR0XZg9iUxRYxek6ubjN672b6W-hlnY4WeLVuYBQFsQVVS0uQ05GvPx02mGEVjcX9db9yzCDbr_UfBZnTwrWx1i4iX35.Ld23XK7ZLaLDBXcMZ-8xQYdjay2Tr4LTZCZnFUGBjVoCJOwmOdrX2Je6I2sX1TRBiZILg2NsaFRWFUYwt9Ome3sLjBFF1vrt4KF0kg.Ncqg25NkORPeos1PRtD4xT4U6rqKlDcvsQQfLhaY3q3ZowJwSOtbzZNWftipHFcR5ADP98vW1uQYeDPJ5qQWUJjsdULyi6nsz-Izjw.ZjrAWoagv3HjfdJiDW8Yq3BDXO6PK_nkNqoPl-EsToUPSYs6m9JvCqEX4kIwQrdRKeVCtctcK0GGqyEO1VZW5Rt7FwfgxgeygfWB9g|Mohammad Hosein Kalantar Motamedi; Masoud Saghafinia; Azadeh Hassani Bafarani; Farzad PanahiComments: Continuous education, training for general population and the people involved in disaster management, and exercise drills based on potential hazards and composed of primary training using scenarios and tabletop exercises all are important aspects of preparedness for disasters due to natural hazards.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives --Research questions |--|This article highlights flaws in management in the variousaspects of this disaster in order to assess what was done, and what shouldbe done to overcome these shortcomings in future disasters|--|A retrospective review of the various aspects of management relatedto the Bam disaster was done via the assessment of files, multi-center studies,governmental data, and available literature from 2003–2008.|--|--|--|--|A comprehensive disaster management plan must not belimited only to the relief phase, but rather must include preparedness,recovery with optimal legislation and budgeting,improvement of healthcare facilities, and provision of organizedcommunication channels between the different governmentaldepartments.|||

These networks usually have stringent constraints on the system resources, making data-extraction and aggregation techniques critically important. However, accurate data extraction and aggregation is difficult, due to significant variations in sensor readings and frequent link and node failures. To address these challenges, we propose data-aggregation techniques based on statistical information extraction that capture the effects of aggregation over different scales. We also design, in this paper, an accurate estimation of the distribution parameters of sensory data using the expectationÃ¢â‚¬â€œmaximization (EM) algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed techniques not only greatly reduce the communication cost but also retain valuable statistical information that is otherwise lost in many existing data-aggregation approaches for sensor networks. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed techniques are robust against link and node failures and perform consistently well in broad scenarios with various network configurations.

1953|Toward the regulation of ubiquitous mobile government: a case study on location-based emergency services in Australia.|Aloudat, Anas ; Michael, Katina|2011|MOBILE communication systems;LOCATION-based services;TELEPHONE answering services;EMERGENCY management;QUALITATIVE research;APPLICATION software;AUSTRALIA;Emergency management;Location-based services;Mobile government;Regulation|Mobile alerts, notifications and location-based emergency warning systems are now an established part of mobile government strategies in an increasing number of countries worldwide. In Australia the national emergency warning system (NEWS) was instituted after the tragic Black Saturday Victorian Bushfires of February 2009. NEWS has enabled the provision of public information from the government to the citizen during emergencies anywhere and any time. Moving on from traditional short message service (SMS) notifications and cell broadcasting to more advanced location-based services, this paper explores the major issues faced by government, business and society at large, toward the realization of a fully fledged emergency system for personal mobile devices. This qualitative study contains two phases: phase 1 gathered issues from the general public via an open-ended survey question, and phase 2 gathered issues from key informant interviews. The data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis techniques. The results are presented in a narrative form granting detailed insight into the main challenges faced in the deployment of a mobile government application. The complex interplay between government agencies, telecommunications carriers and the Australian public is presented, ultimately leading down a path of regulation. By using a qualitative approach it is hoped that the intimate lessons learnt in the Australian landscape can be applied to other nations considering mobile government applications. The outcome of the paper is predominantly practical providing a series of recommendations toward the successful deployment of mobile government applications.

Will we suddenly face large numbers of combat casualties, an earthquake, a plane crash, an industrial explosion, or a terrorist bombing? The daily routine can suddenly be complicated by large numbers of patients, exceeding the ability to treat in a routine fashion. Disaster events can result in patients with penetrating wounds, burns, blast injuries, chemical contamination, or all of these at once. Some events may disrupt infrastructure or result in loss of essential equipment or key personnel. The chaos of a catastrophic event impedes decision-making and effective treatment of patients. Disasters require a paradigm shift from the application of unlimited resources for the greatest good of each individual patient to the allocation of care, with limited resources, for the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. Training and preparation are essential to remain effective during crises and major catastrophic events. Disaster triage and crisis management represent a tactical art that incorporates clinical skills, didactic information, communication ability, leadership, and decision-making.

The objective of this research is to develop an Emergency Response Model (ERM) that can be used by offices of emergency preparedness to evaluate response capabilities, to assess the logistics challenges in the event of natural disaster and to perform what-if analysis on the threat of a weather disturbance system. The first step to develop the ERM is to define the mechanisms and coordination that must be in place among the different emergency management agencies in the event of a natural disaster. Then, the logistics (activities and time frame) that have to be implemented are defined. Finally, a simulation model is built and used to evaluate the effectiveness of current emergency preparedness systems as compared with the proposed system.

A shared image of community risks and resources can facilitate engagement of organizations across sectors and jurisdictions in collective action to reduce shared regional risks. Moreover, creating a reliable, trusted knowledge commons or shared knowledge base for information search, exchange, and updating can support cognition and communication among participating actors, a critical task in achieving effective collective action, especially in urgent, complex, and evolving emergency systems and situations. In this article, we present the initial stage of a prototype decision support system for emergency operations in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. This prototype represents the first step in building a shared knowledge based to support community resilience in multi-jurisdictional regional system. Vetted and endorsed by experienced practicing emergency managers in the county, the prototype system uses geospatial modeling to map resource allocation scenarios in relation to various types of risk in the region. By providing a trusted knowledge base of regional risks and resources, the prototype system can support emergency managers in developing an integrated perspective on shared regional risks and in collectively exploring, assessing, and improving the efficaciousness of coordinated inter-organizational and inter-jurisdictional resource allocation strategies in virtual emergency response and readiness scenarios. Dynamic functions are proposed for future development.

Conducting frequent physical and table-top exercises are neither feasible nor economical. This is where modeling and simulation comes into play in providing a risk-free and economical method to practice various evacuation strategies, train first responders, and provide accurate decision-support and emergency guidance. With the aid of formal methods, here we present a suite of various egress strategies build on top of an open-source modeling and simulation environment. We use Cellular Discrete-Event System Specification (Cell-DEVS) formalism to explore emergency evacuation scenarios by building 12 egress models representing aspects of human behaviors under emergencies and the activities of authorities in guiding the crowd. The proposed framework explores random and controlled human movement, as well as implementing psychological conditions such as herd following and panicked states. We provide results analysis to compare evacuation speed under various egress methods, allowing for decision making when using the suite for training purposes. The outcome of this work is available on a public repository to serve the DEVS community, researchers, and public safety authorities interested in emergency evacuation simulations.

This paper presents our research on the design of a collaborative sense-making system to support team work. We propose a multi-view, role-based design to help team members analyze geo-spatial information, share and integrate critical information, and monitor individual activities. Our design uses coordinated maps and activity visualization to aid decision-making as well as group activity awareness.

2022|An optimization approach for ambulance location and the districting of the response segments on highways|Iannoni, Ana Paula ; Morabito, Reinaldo ; Saydam, Cem|2009|MATHEMATICAL optimization;SIMULATION methods & models;EMERGENCY management;EMERGENCY medical services;AMBULANCES;TELEPHONE emergency reporting systems;Genetic algorithm;Highways;Hypercube model;Location and dispatching of ambulances;Spatially distributed queues|In this paper we present a method to optimize the configuration and operation of emergency medical systems on highways. Different from the approaches studied in the previous papers, the present method can support two combined configuration decisions: the location of ambulance bases along the highway and the districting of the response segments. For example, this method can be used to make decisions regarding the optimal location and coverage areas of ambulances in order to minimize mean user response time or remedy an imbalance in ambulance workloads within the system. The approach is based on embedding a well-known spatially distributed queueing model (hypercube model) into a hybrid genetic algorithm to optimize the decisions involved. To illustrate the application of the proposed method, we utilize two case studies on Brazilian highways and validate the findings via a discrete event simulation model.

2026|Two complementary mobile technologies for disaster warning.|Samarajiva, Rohan ; Waidyanatha, Nuwan|2009|CELL phones;INFORMATION technology;MOBILE communication systems;EMERGENCY management;TELECOMMUNICATION;EMERGING markets;INDUSTRIALIZATION;DEVELOPING countries;ASIA;Mobile communication systems;Natural disasters;Risk management|Purpose - Over 50 percent of the disasters occur in Asia and in the past five year disasters in the region have killed around half million people. Most of these deaths could have been prevented if reliable and effective early warning systems were in place. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the use of the emerging mobile technology for disaster risk reduction. Design/methodology/approach - LiRNEasia field tested five wireless technologies, including mobile phones, in 32 tsunami affected villages in Sri Lanka; where members in the village were provided training with emergency response planning and given one or more of the technologies for receiving hazard information. Further lessons were learned by sharing knowledge, through a consultation process, on early warning systems with stakeholders in India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Findings - The evaluation process concluded mobile phones as the reliable, effective, and affordable solutions for alerting last-mile communities. Disaster risk reduction can be improved using mobile application and leverage the explosive diffusion of the technology even among the poor in developing countries. Practical implications - Coordination within government, including communication to first responders responsible for evacuation and localized warnings, and communication to mass media who serve a critical function in public warning, can be achieved through the use of an SMS engine supplemented as necessary by an informative and robust website. Cell broadcasting can serve as an extremely useful addition to the conventional public warning methods, especially in countries with significant mobile penetration. Originality/value - The paper is intended for governments, researchers and practitioners working in the field of emergency communication.

A TTX consists in a discussion-based emergency management exercise, organized in a simulated emergency scenario, involving groups of players who are subjected to a set of solicitations ('injects'), in order to evaluate their emergency response abilities. This kind of exercise is devoted to identify strengths and shortfalls and to propose potential and promising changes in the approach to a particular situation. In order to manage the TTX derived data collection and analysis, a gap analysis tool would be very useful and functional at identifying the 'gap' between them and specific areas and actions for improvement, consisting the gap analysis in a comparison between actual performances and optimal/expected ones. In this context, a TTX gap analysis tool was designed, with the objective to provide an evaluation of Team players' competences and performances and TTX organization and structure. The influence of both the players' expertise and the reaction time (difference between expected time and time necessary to actually complete the injects) on the final evaluation of the inject responses was also taken into account.

However, many standard collaboration tools can be limited either because they provide passive presentation and dissemination of information, or because they are targeted towards highly specific usage scenarios that require considerable training to use the tools. We present a real-time gather and share system called 'Big Board' which facilitates collaboration over maps. The Big Board is an open-source, web based, real time visual collaborative environment that runs on all modern web browsers and uses open-source web standards developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and WorldWideWeb Consortium (W3C). An evaluation of Big Board was conducted by school representatives in North Carolina for use in situational understanding for school closure decisions during winter weather events. The decision to close schools has major societal impacts and is one that is usually made based on how well a teenage driver could handle wintry precipitation on a road. Collecting information on the conditions of roads is especially critical, however gathering and sharing of this information within a county can be difficult. Participants in the study found the Big Board intuitive and useful for sharing real time information, such as road conditions and temperatures, leading up to and during a winter storm scenario. We have adapted the Big Board to manage risks and hazards during other types of emergencies such as tropical storm conditions.

The study investigates whether or not there are significant differences in the mitigation action plans (MAPs) developed by jurisdictions from states with existing planning mandates in their comprehensive plans prior to DMA2K and those without existing planning mandates. The requirements of such plans include collaboration with several entities, public information and awareness, evacuation, sheltering, provision for special needs populations, terrorism, and technological hazards. The findings from the t-test analysis show there is no significant difference in plans with or without mandates. Results also suggest the need for FEMA to further scrutinize and review the approval process criteria to reflect the inclusion of these identified elements before plans are approved. Such scrutiny could lead to improved plans and subsequently lead to a reduction of impacts of hazards.

2061|A Procedural Construction Method for Interactive Map Symbols Used for Disasters and Emergency Response.|Guoqiang Peng ; Songshan Yue ; Yuting Li ; Zhiyao Song ; Yongning Wen|2017|INTERACTIVE computer systems;DECISION making;EMERGENCY management;MAPPINGS (Mathematics);WENCHUAN Earthquake, China, 2008;disaster mapping;emergency response mapping;interactive map symbol;procedural construction|The timely and accurate mapping of dynamic disasters and emergencies is an important task that is necessary for supporting the decision-making that can improve the efficiency of rescue and response efforts. The existing emergency symbol libraries are primarily composed of point symbols and simple line symbols, focusing on the representation of disasters, related facilities, and operations. However, various existing response factors (e.g., the distribution and types of emergency forces) are also important for further decision-making and emergency responses; there is a need to design complex and diverse symbols to represent this rich information. Moreover, traditional mapping systems only provide static map symbols that cannot be easily edited after creation, making it difficult to support interactive editing after the symbols are mapped, thus hindering the representation of dynamic disasters and response factors. This article targets a solution of the above issues by proposing a procedural construction method of interactive map symbols for dynamic disasters and emergency responses. There are two primary research points. First, an emergency response and decision symbol library was classified and integrated into the existing attachments to form a richer symbol library for comprehensively representing disasters and emergencies. Second, an interactive map symbol procedural construction method was designed based on (1) primitive geometric compositions and geometric graphics algorithms to construct the map symbol graphics; (2) an interactive graphics control and drawing attributes configuration method to support user interactive editing of the visual variables of the mapped symbols; (3) and a dynamic updating and drawing strategy to support the real-time refreshing of the changing visual variables. The experiment was conducted using the Wenchuan earthquake as a case study, and the results demonstrate a powerful capacity of the produced interactive map symbols, which will contribute to the improvement of the mapping efficiency and representation capability of disasters and emergency response.

Two heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve the multi-objective evacuation routing model.

And, the methodology with appropriate modification is suitable for supporting decisions in assessing emergency route selection in other cases (fires, nuclear accidents).The use of the first heuristic algorithm is preferred to other routing optimization techniques because it allows for partitioning for the set of non-dominated solutions according to the results of QAR and individual risk criteria, which can provide reference for policymakers in the emergency decision-making process of evacuation. The use of the second heuristic algorithm is preferred to other dynamic optimization techniques because it allows for a fast calculation of optimal solutions during emergency situations.|The use of the multi-objective optimization allows for the evaluation of each and every possible solution to both sets of criteria, i.e. individual risks and time costs. Furthermore, the use of Pareto optimal set approach avoids subjective judgments and value trade-offs until the very late stage of the optimization procedure. Major subsets of the optimum solution may be discarded without much debate among stakeholders (for example, solutions implying higher risk with minimal decrease in travel time).||
2126|Supporting community emergency management planning through a geocollaboration software architecture.|Schafer, Wendy A. ; Ganoe, Craig H. ; Carroll, John M.|2007|community emergency management planning;geocollaboration software;architecture;vehicle traffic routes;2007;Communities;Computer Software;Emergency Services;Management Planning;Transportation;Towns;2007|Emergency management is more than just events occurring within an emergency situation. It encompasses a variety of persistent activities such as planning, training, assessment, and organizational change. We are studying emergency management planning practices in which geographic communities (towns and regions) prepare to respond efficiently to significant emergency events. Community emergency management planning is an extensive collaboration involving numerous stakeholders throughout the community and both reflecting and challenging the community's structure and resources. Geocollaboration is one aspect of the effort. Emergency managers, public works directors, first responders, and local transportation managers need to exchange information relating to possible emergency event locations and their surrounding areas. They need to examine geospatial maps together and collaboratively develop emergency plans and procedures. Issues such as emergency vehicle traffic routes and staging areas for command posts, arriving media, and personal first responders' vehicles must be agreed upon prior to an emergency event to ensure an efficient and effective response. This work presents a software architecture that facilitates the development of geocollaboration solutions. The architecture extends prior geocollaboration research and reuses existing geospatial information models. Emergency management planning is one application domain for the architecture. Geocollaboration tools can be developed that support community-wide emergency management planning and preparedness. This paper describes how the software architecture can be used for the geospatial, emergency management planning activities of one community.

Secondary sources of data collection included meeting documentsThe semistructured interviews focused on the emergency management coordinator’s approach to emergency management and his perception of the local activities in the community.|||This paper has argued for the community-oriented nature of emergency management planning work. It has described how multiple local agencies come together to prepare for and respond to emergencies.This focus on local agencies and citizen involvement, along with the fact that every emergency occurs in some locale, emphasizes our interest in community emergency management planning.The software architecture described in this paper offers both a design and a toolkit for implementing geocollaboration applications. The architecture allows for the design and development of a variety of geocollaboration software tools. This is particularly well suited for emergency management planning, which has different geocollaboration needs depending on the context. The software architecture allows us, as the researchers, to explore different geocollaboration interactions and features within a specific use context. It also allows the development of unique applications for multiple contexts.The software architecture, and the corresponding tool development, is also beneficial to community emergency management planning. Through the design and development of collaborative tools for emergency planning work practices, a collaborative, virtual environment for emergency management planning can form.Our geocollaborative architecture can also support the unique roles people play in emergency management and allow tools to be tailored to those specific purposes.|Geocollaboration tools can be developed that support community-wide emergency management planning and preparedness.||
2138|Giving meaning to tweets in emergency situations: a semantic approach for filtering and visualizing social data.|Onorati, Teresa ; DÃƒÂ­az, Paloma|2016|EMERGENCY management;MICROBLOGS;INFORMATION visualization;SEMANTIC networks (Information theory);ONTOLOGIES (Information retrieval);SOCIAL aspects;Emergency management;Information categorization;Information visualization;Ontologies;Semantic modeling;TWITTER (Web resource) -- Social aspects|In this paper, we propose a semantic approach for monitoring information published on social networks about a specific event. In the era of Big Data, when an emergency occurs information posted on social networks becomes more and more helpful for emergency operators. As direct witnesses of the situation, people share photos, videos or text messages about events that call their attention. In the emergency operation center, these data can be collected and integrated within the management process to improve the overall understanding of the situation and in particular of the citizen reactions. To support the tracking and analyzing of social network activities, there are already monitoring tools that combine visualization techniques with geographical maps. However, tweets are written from the perspective of citizens and the information they provide might be inaccurate, irrelevant or false. Our approach tries to deal with data relevance proposing an innovative ontology-based method for filtering tweets and extracting meaningful topics depending on their semantic content. In this way data become relevant for the operators to make decisions. Two real cases used to test its applicability showed that different visualization techniques might be needed to support situation awareness. This ontology-based approach can be generalized for analyzing the information flow about other domains of application changing the underlying knowledge base.

Many applications of GIS developed over the last decade provided information necessary for the decision-making in diverse areas including natural resource management, regional planning, and disaster management. Two perspectives on developing better decision support capabilities of GIS can be identified, one based on analytical problem solving as a centrepiece of Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) and another based on integration of GIS and specialized analytical models. According to first perspective, SDSS should offer modelling, optimization, and simulation functions required to generate, evaluate, recommend, and test the sensitivity or problem solution strategies. These capabilities are essential to solving semi-structured spatial decision-making problems. The second perspective on improving the decision support capabilities focuses on the expansion of GIS descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive capabilities by integrating GIS software with other statistical software and analytical models. According to this view, mapping, query, and spatial modelling functions of GIS can provide data display at different scales, preprocessing, and data input for environmental and statistical models. The general objective of Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is to assist the decision-maker (DM) in selecting the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ alternative from the number of feasible choice-alternatives under the presence of multiple choice criteria and diverse criterion priorities. The problem of multicriterion choice in decision making is the paramount challenge faced by individiuals, public and private corporations. The nature of challenge is two-fold: How to identify choice alternatives satisfying the objectives of parties involved in the decision-making process? How to order the set of feasible choice alternatives to identify the most preferred alternative? The challenge of multicriterion choice can be attributed to many spatial decision-making problems involving search and location/allocation of resources. These problems, often analysed in (GIS), include location/site selection for: service facilities, retail outlets, critical areas for specific resource management, and emergency service locations where are key locations for effective emergency management. In this study, the criteria and its priorities/weights that should be considered for finding optimal locations of fire stations are determined; and multicriteria site analysis is conducted based on mentioned criteria weights in (GIS) environment. Moreover, in order to test the sensitivity and robustness of the model developed, a sensitivity analysis is performed based on the combination of the criterion weights by using (GIS) capabilities. With these analyses performed, it is focused on the creating themodel that supports decision makers in decisionmaking for finding theoptimal locations of fire stations. In this study, these steps are followed: Definition of the problem/objective (determining the optimal locations of fire stations); determining the potential criteria in finding the optimal locations of fire stations; data collection and preparation and transfer to (GIS) environment; creation of raster data sets representing the regionalised criteria; classification of raster data sets; establishment of preference matrix, assigning preference values to the relevant criteria by using the pairwise comparison feature of Analytic Hiyerarchy Process (AHP); determination of criteria weights by calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the preference matrix which evaluated by two decision maker group; determining the criteria priorities/weights values by using the synthesis of priorities and calculating the overall composite weights; calculating the result raster (suitability map for potential fire stations) as a weighted summation of all criteria raster data sets; conducting the sensitivity analyses in (GIS) environment in order to test the sensitiveness and robustness of the model developed; offering a system that supports decision makers in determining the optimal locations of fire stations. The integration of the (AHP) and (GIS) combines decision support methodology with powerful visualisation and analysing capabilities which should considerably facilitate finding optimal locations of fire stations and this process improves the decision making in emergency management.

First, the number of rescue tasks posed is usually larger than the number of responders (or agents) and the resources available to them. Second, each task is likely to require a different level of effort in order to be completed by its deadline. Third, new tasks may continually appear or disappear from the environment, thus requiring the responders to quickly recompute their allocation of resources. Fourth, forming teams or coalitions of multiple agents from different agencies is vital since no single agency will have all the resources needed to save victims, unblock roads and extinguish the fires which might erupt in the disaster space. Given this, coalitions have to be efficiently selected and scheduled to work across the disaster space so as to maximize the number of lives and the portion of the infrastructure saved. In particular, it is important that the selection of such coalitions should be performed in a decentralized fashion in order to avoid a single point of failure in the system. Moreover, it is critical that responders communicate only locally given they are likely to have limited battery power or minimal access to long-range communication devices. Against this background, we provide a novel decentralized solution to the coalition formation process that pervades disaster management. More specifically, we model the emergency management scenario defined in the RoboCup Rescue disaster simulation platform as a coalition formation with spatial and temporal constraints (CFST) problem where agents form coalitions to complete tasks, each with different demands. To design a decentralized algorithm for CFST, we formulate it as a distributed constraint optimization problem and show how to solve it using the state-of-the-art Max-Sum algorithm that provides a completely decentralized message-passing solution. We then provide a novel algorithm (F-Max-Sum) that avoids sending redundant messages and efficiently adapts to changes in the environment. In empirical evaluations, our algorithm is shown to generate better solutions than other decentralized algorithms used for this problem.

2194|A dynamic decision support system based on geographical information and mobile social networks: A model for tsunami risk mitigation in Padang, Indonesia.|Ai, Fuli ; Comfort, Louise K. ; Dong, Yongqiang ; Znati, Taieb|2016|DECISION support systems;GEOGRAPHIC information systems;SOCIAL networks;TSUNAMI forecasting;RISK assessment;PADANG (Indonesia);Acquirable affinity information of leader election;Coverage-based probabilistic forwarding message broadcast;Dynamic decision support system;Emergency evacuation route map;Geographic information system (GIS);Padang, Indonesia;Tsunami risk;Twitter|In coastal cities, population and property are concentrated in small areas, with abundant resources and convenient transportation, but also with potential tsunami risk, as shown by the tsunami disasters of 2004, 2010 in Indonesia. Coastal area citizens need to evacuate to a safe place as soon as tsunamis occur. The prime evacuation time is very critical for them, but it is delayed in practice by complex information transfer processes. In recent years, spatial information has become an important resource used in dynamic decision support for emergencies, and smart phones have become a primary social communication device during interactions in emergencies. This paper outlines the design and development of a prototype geographical information system centric, social media based dynamic decision support system (GIS-SM-DDSS) that integrates geographical information with Twitter technology to enable self-organized information networks to support decision making and collective actions in emergency situations. The actors include government policy makers, policy managers, highly influential social leaders in local communities, and policy executors and urban citizens impacted by disasters. The main system functions include dynamic disaster risk analysis, timely dissemination of evacuation strategies to community residents, and real-time detection of environmental risk and evacuation support. This system is designed as a field experiment in Padang, Indonesia, to help public officials design tsunami risk maps with timely evacuation routes and transmit these maps to influential leaders in local neighborhoods that are exposed to tsunami risk. Each neighborhood leader would then tweet the detailed route to citizens that follow the tweet. The proposed has potential to support evacuation strategies and real-time guidance of communities at risk during disaster.

While protection structures may help to reduce the level of hazard and the expected degree of loss, some danger of technical failures or human errors will always remain. For extreme events, the implementation of non-structural measures as early warning systems and disaster management practices is required to ensure the protection of population. During Theseus, a methodology for helping the local authorities to prepare an action plan in case of coastal flooding was developed and tested on the estuary of Gironde in France. The methodology builds over the return of experience from past events and tries to clearly identify all the stages of an evacuation and the thinking process that can lead to a robust evacuation plan. It relies on a conceptual framework Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SADT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which helps to understand how data should be processed from its collection to its use in the plan. The risk scenarios were calculated for current and future conditions of the XXIst century, taking into account the effects of climate change. The methodology is supported by the OSIRIS software, prototyped during the FP5 eponymous project and later distributed by CETMEF and the French basin authorities of Loire and Meuse. The methodology for the preparation of evacuation plans was applied on a pilot city of Theseus, Bordeaux on the estuary of Gironde (France), and the software used to calculate evacuation times was tried out on Cesenatico near the Adriatic coast (Italy). This comparison verified the replicability of methodological guidelines in two different European contexts. The cultural and organizational differences and the different number of people involved underlined strong questions to be addressed when applying them. In order to assess the efficiency of an evacuation strategy and to compute the number of people successfully evacuated over time, a macroscopic model (not representing each individual vehicle but only flows of vehicles in congestion points) for the simulation of traffic congestion was used, based on the work of the University of Twente, Rijkswaterstaat and INFRAM. This model will be integrated in the Theseus decision support system for helping coastal managers to select their strategy for risk mitigation.

As a result, disaster response has been suboptimal and in many instances hampered by lack of planning, education and training, information, and communication. METHODS: The Resource-Poor Settings panel developed five key question domains; defining the term resource poor and using the traditional phases of the disaster cycle (mitigation/preparedness/response/recovery). Literature searches were conducted to identify evidence to answer the key questions in these areas. Given a lack of data on which to develop evidence-based recommendations, expert-opinion suggestions were developed, and consensus was achieved using a modified Delphi process. RESULTS: The five key questions were as follows: definition, capacity building and mitigation, what resources can we bring to bear to assist/surge, response, and reconstitution and recovery of host nation critical care capabilities. Addressing these led the panel to offer 33 suggestions. Because of the large number of suggestions, the results have been separated into two sections: part I, Infrastructure/Capacity in the accompanying article, and part II, Response/Recovery/Research in this article. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of rudimentary ICU resources and capacity to enhance services plagues resource-poor or constrained settings. Capacity building therefore entails preventative strategies and strengthening of primary health services. Assistance from other countries and organizations is often needed to mount a surge response. Moreover, the disengagement of these responding groups and host country recovery require active planning.

This paper presents evidence to suggest that strategic decision-making following a shock event involves a more intuitive, less analytical and less consultative approach, while decision-making in a stable environment is characterised by a more cooperative, formal and analytical process. Decision-making following a shock event tends to be simplified and fast, whereas decision-making in a stable environment tends to be comprehensive and slow. Furthermore, the strategic role of the board transforms following a shock event from a limited involvement in strategy setting to a strong involvement in the setting of strategy. This research has important management implications signifying that crisis management must increasingly focus on building an organisationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to reach swift decisions in crisis situations and avoid analysis paralysis.

To understand the magnitude of the problem and develop effective emergency preparedness plans, emergency scenarios need to be carefully developed and evaluated. This paper presents results from a project that developed and tested emergency response scenarios for the Birmingham, Al. region. First, the CORSIM traffic simulation software was used to model the major area traffic corridors into a regional transportation network. Then, the regional model was utilized to test and evaluate emergency management strategies in response to natural or human-caused disasters. Appropriate preparedness and response measures of effectiveness (MOEs) were selected to support the assessment process at the region-wide and/or corridor level. Candidate response actions were compared and evaluated on the basis of these MOEs and recommendations were developed on best practices and needs. One of the contributions of this work is that it showcases the utility of microscopic traffic simulation for regional emergency preparedness and highlights opportunities and challenges related to the development of large scale microscopic simulation models. Moreover, the project findings can provide guidance to regional transportation officials and public safety agencies toward implementing effective traffic management strategies in the event of an actual regional emergency.

Performance is one of the most important criteria to help users select distributed online GIService for developing geospatial applications including natural hazards and emergency responses. However, performance accuracy is limited by the single-location-based evaluation mechanism while service performance is dynamic in space and time between end-users and services. We propose a spatiotemporal performance evaluation mechanism to improve the accuracy. Specially, a cloud and volunteer computing mechanism is proposed to collect performance information of globally distributed GIServices. A global spatiotemporal performance model is designed to integrate spatiotemporal dynamics for better performance evaluation for users from different regions at different times. This model is tested to support GIService selection in global spatial data infrastructures (SDIs). The experiment confirms that the proposed model provides more accurate evaluations for global users and better supports geospatial resource utilizations in SDIs than previous mechanisms. The methodology can be adopted to improve the services of other regional and global distributed operational systems.

2243|Comparing four operational SAR-based water and flood detection approaches.|Martinis, Sandro ; Kuenzer, Claudia ; Wendleder, Anna ; Huth, Juliane ; Twele, AndrÃƒÂ© ; Roth, Achim ; Dech, Stefan|2015|WATER quality monitoring;WATER quality management;SYNTHETIC aperture radar;REMOTE sensing by radar;IMAGING systems|In recent years, the German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has gained a lot of experience in water surface extraction from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for various application domains. In this context, four approaches have been developed, which jointly form the so-called DFD Water Suite: The Water Mask Processor (WaMaPro) is based on a simple and high-performance algorithm that processes multi-sensor SAR data in order to provide decision-makers with information about the location of water surfaces. The Rapid Mapping of Flooding tool (RaMaFlood) has been developed for flood extent mapping using an interactive object-based classification algorithm. The TerraSAR-X Flood Service (TFS) is used for rapid mapping activities and provides satellite-derived information about the extent of floods in order to support emergency management authorities and decision-makers. It is based on a fully automated processing chain. The last approach is the TanDEM-X Water Indication Mask processor (TDX WAM). It is part of the processing chain for the generation of the seamless, accurate, and high-resolution global digital elevation model (DEM) produced based on data of the TanDEM-X mission. Its purpose is to support the subsequent DEM editing process by the generation of a global reference water mask. In this study, the design of the four approaches and their methodological backgrounds are explained in detail, while simultaneously elaborating on the preferred application domains for the different algorithms. The advantages and disadvantages of the four approaches are identified by qualitatively as well as quantitatively evaluating the water masks derived from data of the TanDEM-X mission for five test sites located in Vietnam, China, Germany, Mali, and the Netherlands.

The test areas are distributed over three continents and are located in Vietnam, the Netherlands, Germany, Mali, and China (Figure 1), covering areas of 538.4, 324.4, 452.9, 284.2, and 120.1 km2, respectively|||In general, the performance of the four approaches is very satisfying: out of the 20 water masks 17 reach OAs of >90% and 11 OAs of >95%. Also, both the UAs and the PAs give reasonable results for nearly all approaches, with most values clearly above 85.0%The four approaches give similar classification results of the PAs, UAs, and OAs in areas where open water surfaces are relatively smooth and the occurrence of water look alike areas is low, i.e. in the test areas of Vietnam and China. In areas of low contrast between open water surfaces and the surrounding non-water areas, the classification result strongly depends on the selected threshold value. In the test area of Mali, many sand-covered areas exist that exhibit backscatter levels nearly as low as water areasIn cases of occurring water look alike areas, TFS and RaMaFlood, which both use auxiliary data derived from digital elevation models, lead to the best classification results.|||

2267|Geotagging Twitter Messages in Crisis Management.|GHAHREMANLOU, LIDA ; SHERCHAN, WANITA ; THOM, JAMES A.|2015|CRISIS management;TAGS (Metadata);MICROBLOGS;WEBSITE tracking software;crisis informatics;knowledge representation formalisms and methods;mircoblogging;ontology;social media;Twitter;TWITTER (Web resource)|During times of crisis microblogging platforms such as Twitter have played an important role as a communication channel to distribute information. Particularly, disaster-related tweets are valuable resources when tagged with their location for detecting unexpected events. However, they often contain different types of location and one of the main challenges is resolving the ambiguity involved in their locations. The process of identifying phrase portions in unstructured texts with possible spatial aspects and disambiguating these references by linking them to geographic coordinates is known as Geotagging. In the context of crisis management, this paper presents OzCT geotagger that automatically detects the location(s) mentioned in the content of tweets with three possibilities: definite, ambiguous and no-location. It also semantically annotates the tweet components utilizing existing and new ontologies. The OzCT geotagger has been recently deployed in a trial system of the OzCrisisTracker application. Experiments demonstrate that the precision and recall for detection of the definite locations against geotagging by human judgement are on average of 80%. We also conclude that the accuracy of geographical focus of the OzCT geotagger is considerably higher than other systems. While existing geocoding systems have lower coverage for suburb and street focus, our approach detects suburbs in more than 60% situations.

Earthquake emergency plans and emergency command systems are among the most important research and operations components of emergency response. These components commonly come with challenges, such as the pertinence of emergency commands and the operability of the countermeasures to be improved. The promise for solving this problem resides with applying knowledge that aids intelligence creation for decision-making. In this paper, we put forward a conceptual model of knowledge for earthquake disaster emergency response (EDER); compositions of EDER knowledge are introduced within architecture. A modeling method incorporating geo-ontology is used to build basic modeling primitives. Geo-ontology serves to represent geospatial characteristics of the EDER knowledge and addresses a need for semantic interoperability in the modeling process. A decision problem framework and a case study have been used as theoretical framework and an application test, respectively, to evaluate the EDER knowledge architecture and models. The EDER knowledge model provides a foundation for intelligent emergency response that helps solve knowledge problems to improve earthquake disaster response.

2276|Preparing for Emergency Situations.|Asproth, Viveca ; Amcoff NystrÃƒÂ¶m, Christina|2010|EMERGENCY management;DISASTER relief;RESCUE work;GOVERNMENT agencies;SOCIAL skills;ORGANIZATIONAL learning;SIMULATION methods & models|Disaster relief can be seen as a dynamic multi actor process with actors both joining and leaving the relief work during the help and rescue phase after the disaster has occurred. Actors may be governmental agencies, non profit voluntary organisations or spontaneous helpers comprised of individual citizens or temporal groups of citizens. Hence, they will vary widely in agility, competence, resources, and endurance. To prepare for for disasters a net based Agora with simulation of emergency situations for mutual preparation, training, and organisational learning is suggested. Such an Agora will ensure future security by: -Rising awareness and preparedness of potential disaster responders by help of the components and resources in the netAgora environment; -Improving cooperation and coordination between responders; -Improving competence and performance of organisations involved in security issues; -Bridging cultural differences between responders from different organizations and different backgrounds. The developed models are intended to reflect intelligent anticipatory systems for human operator anticipation of future consequences. As a way to catch what should be included in this netbased Agora and to join the split pictures that is present, Team Syntegrity could be a helpful tool. The purpose of Team Syntegrity is to stimulate collaboration and incite cross fertilization and creativity. The difference between syntegration and other group work is that the participants are evenly and uniquely distributed and will collectively have the means, the knowledge, the experience, the perspectives, and the expertise, to deal with the topic. In this paper the possibilities with using Team Syntegrity in preparation for the development of a netbased Agora is discussed. We have identified that Team Syntegrity could be useful in the steps User Integration, Designing the netAgora environment, developing Test Scenarios, and assessment of netAgora environment.

Because the use of drills and living labs cannot reproduce social behaviors, such as panic attacks, that strongly affect these plans, the use of agent-based social simulation provides an approach to evaluate these plans more thoroughly. (1) The hypothesis presented in this paper is that there has been little interest in describing the key modules that these simulators must include, such as formally represented knowledge and a realistic simulated sensor model, and especially in providing researchers with tools to reuse, extend and interconnect modules from different works. This lack of interest hinders researchers from achieving a holistic framework for evaluating emergency plans and forces them to reconsider and to implement the same components from scratch over and over. In addition to supporting this hypothesis by considering over 150 simulators, this paper: (2) defines the main modules identified and proposes the use of semantic web technologies as a cornerstone for the aforementioned holistic framework; (3) provides a basic methodology to achieve the framework; (4) identifies the main challenges; and (5) presents an open and free software tool to hint at the potential of such a holistic view of emergency plan evaluation in indoor environments.

Thus, it is important to automate and accelerate the process of urban terrain modeling from sensor data such that the resulting 3D model is semantic, compact, recognizable, and easily usable for training and simulation purposes. To provide essential geometric attributes, buildings and trees must be identified among elevated objects in digital surface models. After building ground-plan estimation and roof details analysis, images from oblique airborne imagery are used to cover building faces with up-to-date texture thus achieving a better recognizability of the model. The three steps of the texturing procedure are sensor pose estimation, assessment of polygons projected into the images, and texture synthesis. Free geographic data, providing additional information about streets, forest areas, and other topographic object types, suppress false alarms and enrich the reconstruction results.

This kind of analysis can be useful in many applications, for example, architects can design occupant-centric floor layouts and ensure that the egress design can handle a wide range of occupant behaviors. The simulation results can also help design and placement of signage to guide evacuation. Such analysis can be useful for facility management to plan evacuation strategies and design emergency training programs.|To realistically predict the building egress performance, designers and managers of the building need to consider not only the building geometry but also the building occupants.Simulating emergency evacuations is a complicated and challenging task.||

It is likely that analysts in these domains will use geovisualizations to develop many analytical results over time. This calls for attention to the problem of collecting, organizing, and making sense out of groups of analytical results - a stage of analysis called synthesis. The research reported here aims to characterize the process of synthesis as it is conducted by analysts working alone, and to suggest design guidelines for new tools to support synthesis in that setting. We have developed a new experimental method for observing and characterizing the process of synthesis. This approach has participants work with a collection of physical data artifacts on a paper-covered workspace to devise hypotheses under the guise of a disease outbreak scenario. From experiment video recordings we identified and coded actions that participants undertook to complete the synthesis task. In this article we report results from synthesis experiments with analysts from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and experts from The Pennsylvania State University. Experiment results are then distilled into a design framework that can be used to shape the development of geovisual synthesis tools.

In addition to complying with code and standards, building designers need to consider the occupants' social characteristics and the unique layout of the buildings to design occupant-centric egress systems. This paper describes an agent-based egress simulation tool, SAFEgress, which incorporates important human and social behaviors observed by researchers in safety and disaster management. Agents in SAFEgress are capable of perceiving building emergency features in the virtual environment and deciding their behaviors and navigation. In particular, we describe four agent behavioral models, namely following familiar exits, following cues from building features, navigating with social groups, and following crowds. We use SAFEgress to study how agents (mimicking building occupants) react to different signage arrangements in a modeled environment. We explore agents' reactions to cues as an emergent phenomenon, shaped by the interactions among groups and crowds. Simulation results from the prototype reveal that different designs of building emergency features and levels of group interactions can trigger different crowd flow patterns and affect overall egress performance. By considering the occupants' perception about the emergency features using the SAFEgress prototype, engineers, designers, and facility managers can study the human factors that may influence an egress situation and, thereby, improve the design of SAFEgress systems and procedures.

SAFEgress can be used to study the effects of human and social behaviors on collective crowd movement patterns. |This paper describes an agent-based egress simulation tool, SAFEgress, which incorporates important human and social behaviors observed by researchers in safety and disaster management.|Planning of the simulation:During the simulation, the dynamic attribute values are updated at each process stage as described belowThe Perception Module updates four attributes such as:• Emergency cues, such as smoke and alarm, that are visible or audible to the agent.• Visible floor objects, such as doors and signs, that are visible to the agent.• Visible group members that are visible to the agent.• Neighboring agents that are visible to and are located within a certain radius from the agentThe Interpretation Module maps the current knowledge of the agent into a set of internal thresholds that describe the urge and well-being of the agent.The decision-making module invokes the decision tree modeling the behavior assigned to the agent. Given the agent’s characteristics and the invoked decision tree, it looks up the agent’s behavior and determines the long- term navigation goal, such as the familiar exit of the agent or the location of the group leader, and the intermediate navigation point given the agent’s knowledge and location.The Locomotion Module calculates the agent’s movement toward the navigation target and returns the updated spatial position of the agents, which areCartesian coordinates (x, y, and z) in the continuous space.The Memory Module registers the decision made during the simulation cycle and updates the spatial knowledge. The spatial knowledge is an array storing the navigation points that the agents have visited. The agents remembered the traveled navigation points and can later refer to the spatial knowledge to avoid backtracking.|Agent Based Simulation Model ||Semantic representation of building safety features, visibility graph  (for the specific technical characteristics and the architecture of the model please see the article)Defined rules: Rule #1 An agent can detect the navigational points that are within the line of sight at each simulation step. Rule #2 An agent chooses intermediate navigation points based on its navigation destinations and its knowledge of the building.Rule #3 An agent ‘‘memorizes’’ the traveled space to avoid backtracking.At the individual level, an agent has a physical profile, a level of familiarity with the building, and prior known exits of at least one that the agent enters. The physical profile includes attributes such as age, gender, body size, travel speed, and personal space.• At the group level, the attributes defined for social groups include a group leader (if any), the group intimacy level (e.g., high intimacy for a family group), the group-seeking property (describing agents’ willingness to search for missing members), and the group influence (describing the influence of a member to the others in the same group). The agents belonging to the same group share the same group attributes.• At the crowd level, an agent’s social position is defined by the social order that reflects the likelihood of the agent to exhibit deference behavior. The lower the social order, the higher the chance for theagent to defer decision to other agents when negotiating the next move. A special agent, such as authority figures and a safety personnel, may have assigned roles and is responsible for executing actions, such as sharing information and giving instructions.|Running the simulation model |N/A|Simulation results from the demonstration indicate that occupant’s exit preferences, visual perception of the signage system, herding behavior, and social behavior among groups can lead to very different reactions to cues.The first test studies the effect of additional exit signs on evacuation performance. The total evacuation time is 165 s (averaged over 10 simulation runs). As highlighted in the figure, in this initial exit sign arrangement, agents take detours and explore the floor before find their way to exit. With additional exit signs posted, the agents travel with more direct routes and the evacuation time takes 119 s (a decrease of 28 % in time compared to that of initial layout of fewer exit signs).The second test illustrates how changing the exit orientation can help direct crowd flow. With the sign arrangement in the first test case, agents tend to exit through the main entrance and cause the congestions at the main entrance. With the proper exit orientation, more agents perceived the exit sign and its direction and evacuated through the near exit. Consequently, the evacuation time is 89 s, a further improvement of 25 %. During the simulation, the agents query the spatial model with the known exits and retrieve the shortest paths to the known exits. At the decision making stage, the agents choose to move to the visible navigation points along the shortest paths to get to their known exits.During evacuation, members belonging to a group, such as families and close friends, concerned the safety of their group members and often seek out and evacuate with the entire group even when evacuation is urgent. Often, as opposed to moving toward familiar exits, people may follow social cues and choose the exits preferred by the crowd as they observe others’ actions. We model the ‘‘following the crowd’’ behavior as follows: during the simulation, the herding agent (who is seeking to follow other agents) perceives the space and detects visible floor objects. At the decision-making stage, the herding agent assesses, for each visible floor object, the number of neighbors who are traveling toward the floor object. The herding agent chooses the visible floor object with the highest number of neighboring agents traveling toward because the agent considers the movement of its neighbors as a social cue to explore potential areas for exits. If there are no visible floor objects that other agents move to, the agent then will adopt other navigation strategies, such as referring to their known exits or following the visual cues.|||

Representing a process of the vehicular evacuation without any support. Each agent move to the closest exit defined by the geographical distance. Agent without support uses the route with minimal length and do not take into account information on congestions. Scenario 2: Ordinary navigators. Simple navigation system has a statistical data on a current roads load. Agents with such system installed find optimal routes by minimization of estimated travel time in congested road network. Scenario 3: Learning navigators. the more advanced navigation system is used. This kind of system allows agents to commit their knowledge to the shared storage. When an agent discovers the flooded road all agents using the system discover this too automatically, and they take this new knowledge into account in their further routing. The knowledge sharing capability could be represented in contemporary navigation systems as a capability to declare information about accidents, road closures. Scenario 4: Navigators with full information about flooding. The full information on flood dynamics is accessible for agents who use the navigation system. It means that all the agents discover information on flooded areas at the moment they became flooded. This case can be projected to reality as a system which collects actual data from the sensors. |Flood model. We use Dynamic Rapid Flood Spreading Model (DRFSM) for flood dynamics simulation.

Strengthening characteristics of materials under high strain rate and damage characteristics of surrounding rock under the action of cyclic loading are considered. Then, dynamic constitutive model of rock mass suitable for civil building aseismic analysis is put forward. At the same time, through the earthquake disaster of time-history simulation of Shenzhen Children's Palace, reliability and practicability of system program is verified in the analysis of practical engineering problems.

The second field test allowed to evaluate the new search technologies. In order to facilitate objective comparisons, both experiments were carried out within two runs, on the one hand with assistive tools of the I-LOV project, and on the other hand without.The second field test took place in a completely destroyed area of 0.58 ha with ten rubble piles at the school of the THW in Hoya, Germany. Three victim performers were hidden in a sewer system under the rubble piles. Furthermore, a worn piece of cloth was placed within one rubble pile, in order to check whether the dogs would neglect correctly this false target. As in the first field test, two runs were performed, but FRIEDAA assisted in both of the cases.|The goal of this paper is to report whether the new assistive technologies have potential to increase the efficiency of a USAR mission based on first field tests during which these novel approaches for victim localization and information fusion have been deployed.|The evaluation was performed by professional USAR workforces of the THW and in particular of the Rapid Deployment Unit for Salvage  operations Abroad (SEEBA) which is trained for assistance in international disaster response.|Search and rescue exercises to test the newly developed technical search means|Detection of victimsLocalization of victimsVerificationRescue |The key to efficient operations is not only the gathering of accurate information, but also its adequate presentation and dissemination that contributes to enhance a collective situational awareness.Especially during USAR operations, the collection and presentation of uncertain information from various sources is challenging. A Decision Support System called FRIEDAA has therefore been developed that additionally has the capability to fuse uncertain information about positive and negative results of search activities.|Simulation|N/A|The assistive search technologies all contributed to more effective search. The synergy with canine search proved to give more accurate results with respect to certainty of presence, location accuracy, and situation awareness. The assistive IT-system enabling digital communication of messages proved to be a valuable tool. It not only enhanced the message volume and detail sent by on-site rescuers improving the collective situational awareness, but also enabled the decision-makers in the Emergency Operation Center to focus on other tasks such as surveillance by disburdening them from the logging task.|The key improvement would be the extension of bidirectional communication between Emergency Operation Center and on-site emergency workforces. The simulation of extrication operations is difficult. A realistic training situation would endanger victim performer and represents a major time investment of 10 h in average.Ongoing developments about Pedestrian Dead Reckoning and SLAM will allow robust localization in all circumstances and enhance the capability to log operational progress in complex three-dimensional terrain.Conventional maps of operational progress are poor in content and functionality compared to GIS supported maps such as delivered by FRIEDAA. The benefits of non-verbal digital transmission of messages became evident through the first field test.Digital management of communication makes it possible to display delay between information in the field and reception in the emergency operation center.The WLAN communication infrastructure was lacking of coverage within and behind buildings during the first field test. The lack of coverage caused delays. However, this can be remedied with other digital radio communication technology such as GSM or TETRA.The SEEBA stressed the importance of portability of the assistive technologies. The bio-radar was particularly promising in this regard. It proved to be a valuable tool for detection of victims in rubble that are unable to alert rescuers.The search probe allowed a hitherto unreachable penetration depth. The navigation pane with two artificial horizons are important for the rescuers to orientate themselves within the rubble pile. A good coordination between the emergency workforce pushing the hose and the one controlling its stiffness and the navigation from the head joints is required.||

The main aim of this study is to simulate the dynamics of the evacuees and derive the evacuation times of the high rise building by using the control volume model. The control volume model assumes that each individual is an independent particle and a virtual closed surface that can be formed by connecting the waiting persons at exit. This model had been successfully used to simulate the dynamic change of the evacuation occupants of the mass rapid transit station. In this study, the evacuation simulation process is divided into five stages and based on the assumptions of homogeneous flow with merge flow ratio where the exit flows from different floors meet and merge together. Seven scenarios are analyzed by using the various values of the parameters which influenced the evacuation process in the high rise building including walking speed, coefficient of flow rate and merge flow ratio. The simulation results are found to be in good agreement with the results of NFPA method. Furthermore, the dynamic characteristics of the evacuation process at each time-step for each of the floors are presented and discussed.

The  evacuation time is obtained by dividing the distance between the floor exit and the nearest room exit by the walking speed.Stage 2: the exit flow enters the stairwell and the stagnation occurs at the floor exit when the summed flow rates of all room exits in a single floor exceed the flow rate of that floor exit. The evacuation time is not measured until the occupants descended to the next floor.Stage 3: when the stair entry flow arrives at the lower floor and meets with the sources of exiting occupants, it is called ‘‘merge flow’’ (i.e. merge stage). This stage is assumed that the summed merge flow capacity of the n + 1th floor’s stair flow and the nth floor’s exit flow islarger than the maximum stair capacity. Stage 4: the simulation entered stage 4 when the number of the occupants of a single floor approaches the floor capacity. The maximum number of the occupants a floor can be obtained by two components: stair landing area (m2) multiplied by maximum crowd density of the stair landing (people/m2), and stairwell area (m2) multiplied by maximum crowd density of the stairwell (people/m2). The descending flow is consisted of both stair entry flow and the outflow of the floor. When the occupants fully load the stairwell, the stair entry flow between ground floor and second floor will keep the maximum stair flow.Stage 5: Formula 5 and 6 demonstrate that the higher the floor the smaller the flow rate of the floor when the value of the merge flow ratio is lower than a certain constant and the number of the stagnating occupants in the stairwell reaches the maximum. As a result, the occupants on the second floor take the lead in arriving at the ground floor and yet finish the escape behind others. On the contrary, when the value of the merge flow ratio exceeds a certain constant, the occupants of the roof floor take the lead in entering the stairwell.|Computer based simulation  (control volume model)|Walking speed, coefficient of flow rate and merge flow ratio.|Simulation |Simulation modelSeven scenarios are analyzed by using the various values of the parameters which influenced the evacuation process in the high rise building including walking speed, coefficient of flow rate and merge flow ratio. |N/A|To sum, it is found that the merge flow ratio influences sequence of floors to be evacuated and time required for complete evacuation when coefficient of flow rate and velocity of walking remained a constant. It consumes least time for total evacuation when merge flow ratio R is equal to 1. The occupants of the lower floors finish evacuation sooner when R is less than 1. The occupants of the higher floors arrive at safe areas sooner when R is more than 1, which is similar to NFPA method. The simulation results are also illustrated that with same walking speed value, the influence of coefficient of specific exit flow and specific stair flow is obvious. The higher the coefficient value, the shorter the total evacuation time is. When stagnation happened in the floors, increasing walking speed do not influence much in shortening the evacuation time.|In order to better align to the real-world evacuation process and understand the dynamics of the evacuees in time scale, it is expected that recent experimental studies on how walking speed and coefficient of flow rate changed can be built in this model in the foreseeable future.||

In the study described in this article, the beliefs and organizational practices pertaining to community EHEP outreach and capacity were explored through key informant (KI) interviews (N = 14) with a sample of governmental EH and EPR administrators and top-level managers from Riverside and San Bernardino counties in Southern California. The results indicate that KIs were highly confident in their workforces' efficacy, ability, willingness, and motivation to directly engage local communities in EHEP. Best practices to combat organizational and systematic barriers to community EHEP outreach were identified. Based on the authors' results, training in participatory methods is needed to bridge technical knowledge in emergency management to daily practice. The lessons learned will form the basis of future interventions aimed to prepare EH and EPR professions to implement community-focused emergency preparedness strategies.

The team-building exercise consisted of 7 performance components and 4 fictional disaster scenarios printed on 32-piece puzzles. The (unsolved) puzzles were presented to teams in large envelopes and teams were evaluated based on their ability to assign tasks and verbalizeappropriate responses to threats presented while completing the puzzle. The communications exercise consisted of three scenarios (bus crash, factory explosion, and chemical leak) and teams were rated on their ability to communicate clinical disaster information. Trainees also participated in a triage module during which 60 small toys imprinted with clinical information were presented and classified according to Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (commonly known as START) criteria as green (minor injuries), yellow (injuries requiring delayed medical attention), red (injuries requiring immediate attention), or black (dead, expectant death, or beyond medical help).During the afternoon session, trainees participated in a clinical disaster scenario inside a large, university-based human patient simulation center. One of the center’s larger observation rooms was designed to resemble a small emergency department waiting room with several chairs, a security guard’s desk, a metal detector, and communication devices. High- and low-fidelity patient simulators and up to 15 trained actors mimicked the chaos and demands of a real event. During the training scenario, students assessed and treated both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients presenting with various levels of medical acuity. Working in teams of four to six, trainees were asked to mitigate the complex and chaotic scene using skills they had learned during the didactic and small-group lessons.|CHPTER was established in 2009 with the goal of enhancing regional health security and patient surge competency by offering patient care providers, including clinicians and volunteers, hands-on lessons that will protect and save lives during a disaster. A 1-day emergency preparedness training (EPT) course that includes a loud, chaotic clinical disaster scenario was developed. A two-part workforce assessment survey to further refine regional EPT needs was administered.||To improve and expand on the curriculum, CHPTER developed a two-part, online patient care provider workforce assessment survey to evaluate the disaster preparedness capabilities of patient care providers in our region (North and South Carolina). In the first survey, 41 emergency department (ED) directors were contacted using databases provided by the South Carolina College of Emergency Physicians. A second voluntary survey developed in 2011 measured levels of preparedness, recorded training preferences, and assessed patient care provider EPT needs. Based on a review of previous disasters affecting the United States, the task force defined patient care provider as any person who would likely care for patients during a disaster, including clinical providers, emergency medical services, mental health providers, volunteers, and other potential providers. CHPTER used existing databases from private, public, and nonprofit provider networks to recruit participants for the second survey. Because several of the recruitment databases overlapped with North Carolina, providers who worked in North Carolina also were included.|Not indicated |Not indicated |The 1-day EPT course enhanced patient care providers’ knowledge, comfort level, and skills required to save lives during a disaster. Twenty-one emergency department directors and 400 patient care providers responded to the surveys. The majority of emergency department directors surveyed believe that one in five of their provider workforce would fail to properly perform their expected duties in a disaster. More than half of the patient care providers reported fewer than 2 hours of annual EPT training and 40% of employers required no annual training. The most significant barriers to widespread dissemination of EPT were financial constraints and time availability of providers.|||

Assessments help to define the damage and changes in functions at the time of the assessment. Assessments are transectional across the longitudinal phases of the disaster. Any intervention should be preceded by an assessment(s). The assessment process is deconstructed into a series of 10 steps: (1) need to know; (2) define the goal(s) and objectives(s) of an assessment; (3) select the appropriate indicators; (4) define the methods to be used for the assessment; (5) develop and test a plan for data collection; (6) train and brief data collectors; (7) gather (collect) the data; (8) synthesise the data and information collected; (9) output information for decision-making; and (10) compare findings with overarching goal and objectives. Steps 7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ9 constitute a production process. Understanding this process is essential for identification of points of success and failure in achieving the desired assessment.Assessments require careful selection of indicators. The selected indicators are used throughout the process. Currently, no standardised set of indicators has been validated. Criteria for the composition of assessment teams are provided and common sources of error are discussed. Prior to, during, and following disasters, assessments are directed by the appropriate coordination and control entity.

However, there is no clear approach to modeling these systems and envisioning their capabilities at the design time. Therefore, the process of designing these systems is ad hoc and its real impact is evaluated once the solution is already implemented, which is risky and expensive. This paper proposes a modeling approach that uses human-centric wireless sensor networks to specify and evaluate models of IoT-based systems at the time of design, avoiding the need to spend time and effort on early implementations of immature designs. It allows designers to focus on the system design, leaving the implementation decisions for a next phase. The article illustrates the usefulness of this proposal through a running example, showing the design of an IoT-based solution to support the first responses during medium-sized or large urban incidents. The case study used in the proposal evaluation is based on a real train crash. The proposed modeling approach can be used to design IoT-based systems for other application scenarios, e.g., to support security operatives or monitor chronic patients in their homes.

The accident left fifty-two dead people and over six hundred injured.Deviation in the plan (here I included the issues happened in real case different than the planned one)The emergency center performed a formal dispatch of resources, particularly firemen, police officers and ambulances. By that time, the traffic and communications in the area had collapsed, therefore the dispatched resources (many of them were HBS) experienced numerous difficulties, not only in arriving to the emergency site, but also in receiving and reporting information.|Literature study and analysis of a real case.|Readibility of the information|A real case|surveillance cameras, reports|Not indicated|A hypothetical IoT-based system was proposed in the study. The system design was simplified to ease its readability; however, the system model is still complex enough as to show the usefulness of the proposed modeling approach. In this case we have considered that all resources are present during the same time slot; i.e., all of them are working simultaneously. There are four islands: the affected area, the city command center, and two hospitals. There are ambulances transporting injured people to the hospitals, and several other node types working within the islands. Provided that the communication support collapses immediately after these events, during the preparedness phase the emergency response organizations must design a robust channel to exchange information among the main players (i.e., islands). The system implements such a channel using witness units (i.e., Local Information Repository—LIR) communicated through stable communication links. The information exchange is managed by a processing unit. Such a process takes advantage of the idle bandwidth of the channel in order to replicate the key information among the several witness units supporting the process (one unit per island). The nodes working within an island consume the information from the LIRs. These repositories can be implemented using several computing devices (typically, from a laptop to large servers), depending on the amount of information that they need to manage.Computing this system model it is possible to identify its strengths and weaknesses, and improve it iteratively at the design time. Moreover, the model can also be used to determine the best procedures to follow during the emergency diagnosis, response and recovery, by making these procedures more effective and efficient.|Analyzing the accident video records helps to estimate the size and type of the emergency in approximately one minute. Sharing video records with the proper emergency center could have triggered a quick response in only a few minutes resulting in more saved lives.The first paramedic (i.e., HBS) arriving to an overcrowded hospital could record the hospital status in one or most witness units, and thus other ambulances accessing such an information can know where exactly to transport the people.The hospital managers (i.e., potential HBS) could have made public the list of injured people located there, e.g., through a Web portal or in a witness unit, allowing thus civilians (also HBS) to perform their searches quickly and without jeopardizing the emergency response activities.A missing person was found 48h later, The rescuers scanned over the spot without noticing his presence. This situation could have been addressed more effectively through the use of a contactless Smart card called SUBE (that stands for Electronic Ticket Unified System), that identifies each user. By making a small extension to the current ICT infrastructure supporting the SUBE, it is possible to sense (e.g., count) the number of people in the train, and also the identity and location of each passenger.Emergency reports ere nor clear, except that the telephone networks (both wired and wireless) collapsed immediately after the incident and that they were down for some hours. There is no report on the use of mobile antennas and only VHF radio systems seem to be used to support communication in the field. This situation is aligned with many other large incidents affecting urban areas.There was no predefined response plan, leading to a collapse in the first response process.The amount and type of resources required could also be pre-calculated improving thus the time and effectiveness of the response process.Although the technology to implement IoT-based solutions that support urban emergency responses is already available, there are no clear guidelines about the role played by each component type, how to integrate them, and how to design the behavior of an integral solution||

This article presents an adapted evacuation planning methodology that essentially incorporates the traditional four-step planning model and dynamic traffic assignment. The authors utilize the transportation network in Western Massachusetts as an example to test the effectiveness of the proposed methodology using two with-notice hurricane evacuation scenarios. The analysis is performed by using the off-the-shelf computer-based planning software package TransCAD to assist the four-step transportation planning process. By altering inputs and using dynamic traffic assignment, TransCAD can be used to predict how the transportation system behaves during an evacuation. Two scenarios are used as the basis of the evacuation modeling. A production-attraction model is presented to replicate the behavior of evacuees. The production-attraction model results are compared with a series of reports, and the model falls within the recommendations of these reports. Several different evacuation speeds are examined for two different study areas. The Results section shows the outputs that can be garnered from the program such as the clearance time, critical locations, V/C ratios, and location-to-location travel times. Finally, recommendations are made on how these results can be used to aid planners. It is worth mentioning that the proposed evacuation modeling methodology can be extended and implemented in other places with minor modifications of network topology and localized travel behavior data.

The scenario examined is as follows: hurricane force winds enter the county at 10 a.m. 24 h after the evacuation order has been made. Everyone heads to theWest because the hurricane tract may move to the East.Scenario 2: This scenario is the same as the first scenario; an evacuation order is given at 10 a.m., and people fully evacuate the four counties. In this case, the hurricane path is headed up through the center of the map causing people to evacuate to the East and West.|Four step transportation planning model: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and traffic assignment, aia software package TransCAD, which provides planners a set of tools that enables them to display, manage, and analyze travel behavior data.||The analysis is performed by using the off-the-shelf computer-based planning software package TransCAD to assist the four-step transportation planning process.

Several different evacuation speeds are examined for two different study areas. The Results section shows the outputs that can be garnered from the program such as the clearance time, critical locations, V/C ratios, and location-to-location travel times.|Scenario 1: Using Equations 1 and 3 in Berkshire County, the average production rate is 1.01 trips per household. This value is obtained by dividing the total number or trips by the total number of households in the county. To convert this rate into another metric for comparison, the number of trips made are added together and then divided by the total number of vehicles in the county. The result of this calculation is that the residents use 66% of the available vehicles during the evacuation.Scenario 2: Using Equations1 and 3, the trips per household and total trips as a percentage of vehicles used for the evacuation are about one trip per household and 64% of the available vehicles are used. Referencing Table 1, these values are low, but the trips taken as a percentage of vehicles are within or near the acceptable ranges. Significant changes are not made from this portion of the model from the Berkshire-only case. The first assigned period is the period from 5 to 6. The amount of departure periods varied from 18 for the slow speed and 12 for the fast speed.|N/A|As the majority of the process is the same for the isolated county as well as the full four-county area, the same sorts of results can be obtained. Very similar  results for the reduction in trips produced are found in the four-county evacuation. The percent decreases for HBW, HBNW, NHB, and the total number of trips are 86%, 16%, 17%, and 50%, respectively. This again heavily corresponds with the time of the day that the hurricane evacuation order is given. The later in the day the evacuation is ordered the more these percentages drop (more regular trips are taken). The TAZs that have less than one vehicle per household for Hampden County are shown in Figure 3. The other two counties also have several TAZs with a low number of vehicles per household, but these TAZs are not shown. The results for Berkshire County have already been shown in an earlier section. No additional TAZs have deficient vehicle space when taking into account the assumed capacity of the vehicles. The only TAZ in the region without enough space is shown in a previous section.One of the most important results for the hurricane evacuation is the clearance time. The fast evacuation clears by 1 a.m. for a clearance time of 16 h, and the slow evacuation clears by 5 a.m. for a clearance time of 20 h. The clearance times for Berkshire County can be isolated from the four-county model. These results line up well with the Berkshire County–only model, but a very small trickle of traffic is still on the network from 8 p.m. until the actual clearance time at 5 a.m.. If 8 p.m. is taken as the time when the vast majority of the vehicles are out of the county, then the clearance times agree.(for more detailed information on the two specific case please see the article)The results for the Berkshire County as well as the four-county model are presented at the end of each scenario. These models are based on the four-step planning model, which is usually used in transportation planning, with some less than usual assumptions for some portions of the model. Similar results are provided for both scenarios. The specific solutions to these problems are not pertinent to an audience outside of Western Massachusetts; therefore, general solutions that can be made from this type of information are presented. These results can be very valuable to the decision support system. Once the clearancetimes are known the decision arc, or the time the decision needs to be made to evacuate before the arrival of the hurricane, can be found. This allows officials to confer with the weather service, or similar groups, to determine the characteristics of the hurricane. The decision makers still need to determine what speed they think that their population will evacuate at, but this can be nudged by making stronger or weaker cases for evacuation. The citizens of a county so far away from the coast that are not used to hurricanes will react differently than residents of coastal states. Potential travel times can be relayed to the public to inform them of what routes might be significantly delayed. Some routes in the network may be underutilized. Through this methodology, the routes can be discovered and then that information can be reported to the public. In this case, Route 2 to the west is underutilized, and it may be a good idea to tell that to the people living in the northern end of Berkshire County. If certain areas inside of a county do not have enough vehicles to evacuate then shelters can be stocked with extra food, water, and beds. Buses can be diverted to take care of these areas as well. The citizens of these counties can be notified via radio or television about the availability of extra buses or shelter space. Overall, TransCAD and the four-step transportation planning model are capable to use for evacuation modeling. The GIS mapping tools provided with the software allow for the stitching together of the network, and they also allow the information to be mapped in an efficient manner. The computation process turns out to be very efficient in this case considering the size of the evacuation network. The inclusion of the DTA module allows for a more realistic model of an evacuation. There are downsides to the deterministic user equilibrium method. An assumption of this model is that people have perfect information and perfect knowledge of the network. This may not be the case during a hurricane evacuation. If a system optimal (instead of user equilibrium) dynamic traffic assignment module were implemented, the software could be more useful in determining what the  evacuation routes should be for the shortest network travel time.|Further research must be completed to hone the friction factor in the trip distribution step. This model assumes reasonable values, but specific hurricane distributions would help improve the accuracy of the model.||

Acute care providers are the first to respond to mass emergencies from the healthcare sector. The preparedness of acute care providers in New Zealand to respond to mass emergencies has not been previously studied. Objective To assess the self-reported training and experience of New Zealand acute care providers to respond to mass emergencies and the factors associated with strong preparedness. Methods A cross-sectional national survey of 1500 acute care providers in New Zealand carried out between 2009 and 2010. The survey assessed experience, training and self-reported preparedness. It also determined the factors associated with strong perceived preparedness. Results The response rate to this survey was 60.7%. Nurses had a higher response rate than doctors or paramedics. Only 29.2% of acute care providers reported responding to a previous mass emergency event. There were 53.5% of acute care providers who reported having formal training in how to deal with mass emergencies, whereas 58.1% of participants reported that they were aware of their role during a healthcare mass emergency response. The factors associated with self-reported strong preparedness to deal with mass emergencies included: being a paramedic, previous training, participation in a drill, willingness to report to work during an infection or man-made emergency, ability to triage and general awareness of the role during a mass emergency. Conclusion Almost half of New Zealand acute healthcare providers have no training in dealing with mass emergency events. Training and general awareness of the role during a mass emergency response were the main factors associated with strong self-reported preparedness of acute care providers. The apparent efficacy of training allied to lack of availability means that it should be a national priority.

It also determined the factors associated with strong perceived preparedness.|It consisted of 26 questions divided into domains, such as demographics, experience, training and perceived preparedness. Sample size calculations were based on detecting a 25% difference in variables between occupational groups with 80% power. Based on similar surveys, the response rate was expected to be around 50% in each group. Therefore, the target sample of participants was estimated to be 500 from each occupation.The study sample included medical practitioners (surgeons, emergency physicians, intensivists/anaesthetists) who were identified at a random sample of 200 registered acute care specialists from the New Zealand Medical Council list. The study also included another 300 participants drawn from the list of registrars and medical officers working in surgical, emergency, intensive care and anaesthesia services at the time of the survey. This is done in order to capture acute care medical practitioners in-training. Furthermore, a random sample of 500 nurses was selected from the members registered by the New Zealand Nurses Organisation (NZNO) who were working in surgical, emergency, intensive care and anaesthesia. Finally, a random sample of 350 paramedics from St John’s ambulance were invited to participate in the survey, as well as 150 others from Wellington Free Ambulance.Postal surveys were distributed between November 2009 and January 2010. A reminder survey was sent to non-responders a month following the initial invitation. All returned surveys were checked for completion and directly entered into a pre-designed collection sheet in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 19.0 (for Microsoft, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).|Inferential tests were carried out for nominal data using Pearson’s χ2 testing (or the Fisher’s exact test where appropriate), and for ordinal data, the Student’s t-test.4,5 The significance of the difference between groups of acute care providers was assessed using an independent twosample t-test.6 A P value ≤0.05 was considered significant. The relationship between the categorical independent variables and being ‘strongly prepared’ was analysed by the binary regression procedure in SPSS to calculate prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The ORs from the crude model were then adjusted by stepwise forward regression to assess the effects of possible confounders.|Not indicated |There are 29.2% of New Zealand acute care providers who have previous experience in mass emergency management.There are 53.5% of New Zealand acute care providers who have had formal mass emergency training.Training is associated with 2.4 fold increase in self-reported strong preparedness to respond to mass emergencies among acute care providers in New Zealand.Previous experience in dealing with mass emergency was not significantly associated with self-reported preparedness of acute care providers. However, acute care providers who received formal mass emergency training were 2.37 times more likely to report being prepared than those who had no training.Participants who were willing to report to work during an infectious disease mass emergency were 48% more likely to report being strongly prepared to respond to a mass emergency. On the other hand, willingness to respond to natural mass emergencies was not associated with perceived preparedness among acute care providers. New Zealand acute care providers who were willing to respond to a man-made mass emergency were 4.6 times more likely to feel prepared than those who were not willing.The present study showed that providers who thought they could find a written emergency plan were 3.07 times more likely to feel prepared to respond to a mass emergency compared with those who reported they could not find a plan. Personnel who were aware of their role during mass emergencies were 3.21 times more likely to report strong preparedness than those who were not aware of their role during a mass emergency event.The present study found that the ability to triage resources was associated with an increased mass emergency preparedness.The report also highlighted the value of continuous preparedness and coordination between pre-hospital and hospital-based health services in successful mass emergency response.|Obtaining high response rates to postal and online surveys in an acute care setting is a challenge because of the inherited nature of healthcare provision in such a context.The study did not gather data on several important variables, such as the level of qualifications, personal circumstances and level of healthcare practices. These factors were shown to be implicated in preparedness and willingness of acute care providers to respond to mass emergencies.||
2505|Flood susceptibility analysis and its verification using a novel ensemble support vector machine and frequency ratio method.|Tehrany, Mahyat ; Pradhan, Biswajeet ; Jebur, Mustafa|2015|FLOOD damage;SUPPORT vector machines;NATURAL disasters;EMERGENCY management;KELANTAN;Decision tree (DT);Flood susceptibility;GIS;Malaysia;Remote sensing;Support vector machine (SVM)|Flood is one of the most commonly occurred natural hazards worldwide. Severe flood occurrences in Kelantan, Malaysia cause damage to both life and property every year. Due to the huge losses in this area, development of appropriate flood modeling is required for the government. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques can support overall flood management as they can produce rapid data collection and analysis for hydrological studies. The existing models for flood mapping have some weak points that may improve through more sophisticated and ensemble methods. The current research aimed to propose a novel ensemble method by integrating support vector machine (SVM) and frequency ratio (FR) to produce spatial modeling in flood susceptibility assessment. In the literature, mostly statistical and machine learning methods are used individually; however, their integration can enhance the final output. The FR model can perform bivariate statistical analysis and evaluate the correlation between the flooding and classes of each conditioning factors. The weights achieved by FR can be assigned to each conditioning factor and the resulted factors can be used in SVM analysis. In order to examine the efficiency of the proposed ensemble method and to show the proficiency of SVM, another machine learning algorithm such as decision tree (DT) was applied and the results were compared. To perform the methods, the upper catchment of the Kelantan basin in Malaysia was chosen. First, a flood inventory map with a total of 155 flood locations were extracted from various sources over the study area. The flood inventory map was randomly divided into two dataset; 70 % (115 flood locations) for the purpose of training and the remaining 30 % (40 flood locations) was used for validation. The spatial database included digital elevation model, curvature, geology, river, stream power index, rainfall, land use/cover, soil type, topographic wetness index and slope. For model validation, area under curve method was used and both success and prediction rate curves were calculated. The validation results for ensemble method showed 88.71 and 85.21 % for success rate and prediction rate respectively. The DT model showed 87.00 and 82.00 % for the success rate and prediction rate respectively. It is evident that the accuracies were increased using the ensemble method. The acquired results proved the efficiency of the proposed ensemble method as rapid, accurate and reasonable in flood susceptibility assessment.

Monsoon floods affect the area every year that made it as a major flood-prone area in Kelantan River Basin. Based on the location and characteristic of this state and the predicted climate condition in this area, it is obvious that Kelantan is highly susceptible to the flood occurrence. In this study, the flood event of November 2005 was used as flood inventory. The maximum annual rainfall reaches 1,750 mm in the monsoon season (November–January).

An early warning system is designed to detect impending danger and send appropriate and clear signals to at risk communities and organizations at the right time and in an unambiguous way. This study aimed to determine early warning system for disaster within health organization in Iran. Methods: This article presents the findings of a mixed-methods study of early warning systems for disaster management within the health organizations in Iran. During the years 2011 to 2012, a sample of 230 health managers was surveyed using a questionnaire and 65 semi-structured interviews were conducted with public health and therapeutic affairs managers who were responsible for disaster management. Results: A range of problems were identified. Although there is a multi-agency alert system within the health organizations, other indicators of early warning system are not satisfactory. Furthermore, standard messages which are used to alert organizations are not used under the current system. Conclusion: Some activities such as memorandum of understanding among different stakeholders of disaster response and education of staff and communities could improve the response to disasters within the health organizations.

Therefore, it is of pivotal importance to speed up the preparation and scheduling process. In other words, only when the preparation process and scheduling process coordinate well, could the emergency supplies arrive at disaster area in time. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to explore a method that can strengthen the coordination in various kinds of situations. Design/methodology/approach Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The paper first elaborates the preparation and scheduling process of emergency supplies in disasters. Then, it establishes a workflow simulation system of the emergency supplies preparation and scheduling based on Petri Net. Afterward, the paper proposes a simplified simulation system of emergency supplies preparation and scheduling which can be employed in actual emergency response. Finally, the paper takes China Lushan Earthquake for a case study. Findings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ By employing the simulation system proposed by this paper, decision makers can simulate the whole emergency supplies preparation and scheduling process, which can help them find a method that can optimize the current process. Specifically, by analyzing the simulation results, the government can obtain conclusions as follows. First, whether the preparation and scheduling process of emergency supplies can speed up or not. Second, which part of the process should be improved to realize the acceleration. Third, the workload of the staffs and experts. Fourth, whether it is necessary to add staffs or experts to work in parallel. Originality/value Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This paper proposes a system that can coordinate the preparation process and scheduling process of emergency supplies in disaster. Then, it employs the Petri Net based workflow model to do simulation. The simulation results show that the system designed is reasonable and can be used in practical decision making on the preparation and scheduling of emergency supplies.

However, Petri Net based workflow system is seldom used in the emergency supplies preparation and scheduling, though it may be quite appropriate.The paper intends to employ the Petri Net based workflow system to simulate the preparation and scheduling process of emergency supplies in disasters. Based on this, it will obtain the methods to optimize the process in different situations. China Lushan Earthquake was taken as the case study to verify the practicability of the Petri Net based workflow simulation system.|Workflow simulation system|Coverability, boundedness and liveness (p.432)|A real case was studied in this article, how the data was collected during the real case was indicated in the article as in the following:All the corresponding departments in the government and air force began to collect disaster information. Based on the information collected, the government informed the geological, emergency management and medical experts to assess the possible types of emergency supplies which are needed by the victims. Afterward, multiple rounds of Delphi decision-making were conducted to determine the requirement quantity of each emergency resources type.Although the government had inventory for all the resources, the stock volume could not meet the relief demand of the disaster. Food was the first resource being acquired, so it should be the first batch of emergency supplies that needs transportation. Since the current road information between the distributing center and disaster areas had not collected yet, the government used the daily time-consuming of passing through the routes to calculate the optimal transportation strategy. Based on the “emergency supplies optimal transportation strategy algorithm,” the government knew that the minimum time interval of the truck arriving at distributing center was 90 minutes.|It is assumed that there are 100 batches of emergency supplies to be prepared in this period. Additionally, the average time-consuming of supplier’s preparation, media reporting, corporation donation, emergency supplies leaving for distributing center and computer calculating optimal transportation strategy is 20, 10, 20, 30, 10 minutes, respectively. That is, tTP¼20, tTM¼10, tTD¼20, tTL¼30, tTA¼10. Additionally, the groups of negotiation staffs (hereinafter called “staffs”) and of experts contains ten people, respectively. We simulate the elements, including maximum queue length (MQL), average waiting time (AWT) and PN, based on different situations and whether to order resources from suppliers or request donation. Provided that the time utilization of staffs and experts is 80 percent, the success probability of negotiation between the government and supplier is 80 percent, we use the emergency supplies preparation and scheduling workflow system framework to make simulation based on WoPeD software. We run 20 times for each case and get average values.|Not indicated |By employing the simulation system proposed by this paper, decision makers can simulate the whole emergency supplies preparation and scheduling process, which can help them find a method that can optimize the current process.

Then, it employs the Petri Net based workflow model to do simulation. The simulation results show that the system designed is reasonable and can be used in practical decision making on the preparation and scheduling of emergency supplies.The negotiation time accounts for a considerable proportion of preparation and scheduling period. However, one group of experts is enough due to the short time-consuming of making decisions. Moreover, if the experts use more than half of the working hours to do decision making, the operating speed of the whole process would not be influenced.|||

In view of this, many approaches have been proposed from different viewpoints, but limitations of them always exist more or less. Instead of presenting a new approach, we expand an existing staged evacuation algorithm for one exit to solve evacuation problems with multiple exits in this paper. The principle is to assign evacuees to different exits to translate a multi-exit problem to several single-exit problems. The objective is to balance traffic flow among exits and reduce the total clearance time, and thus a series of allocation and optimisation strategies are proposed to approach it. Experiments validate the proposed methods, and a simulation program is also developed to visually examine their performance.

The objective is to balance traffic flow among exits and reduce the total clearance time and thus a series of allocation and optimization strategies are proposed to approach it.|Not indicated |The proposed approach is implemented in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 by C#, and with it, a series of experiments are conducted on a Pentium 4 computer with 2.0 GHz CPU, 2 GB main memory and 100 GB free hard disk storage space. A road network consisting of 312 arcs and 247 nodes is employed as the study area. Fives nodes are designated as exits; 109,462 evacuees are randomly distributed on the network and are classified into 242 evacuation groups according to their closeness to surrounding nodes. (several figures are included in the article).Assumptions:(1) Every evacuation group can moves at the same speed, denoted as speed, when there is no traffic congestion.(2) There is no background traffic.(3) Road segments having the same number of traffic lanes are selected for the sake of evacuation. ||Evacuation time, individual travel time, exposure time and exposure time, time-based risk and evacuation exposure, time space based risk and evacuation exposure, choice of route, destination and starting time||After the initial allocation, each evacuation group has been assigned to a single exit. Therefore, the existing staged evacuation algorithm can be applied to calculate the departure time of each evacuation group for making evacuation order, and the whole evacuation process can be treated as z parallel sessions. There are several diagrams and calculations given in the article for more detailed information.|N/A|The existing algorithm can schedule the departure time for each evacuation group with respect to the structure of the road network, the capacity of this group and the traffic congestion, and plan a route to the single exit. During the optimisation process, to reduce traffic conflicts, a procedure is presented to replace part of the existing algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can be applied to a multi-exit evacuation. With the optimisation process, the total clearance time can be reduced and traffic flow among exits can be balanced.|theoretically, it is hard to prove that the obtained optimal allocation must be the best solution, due to the complexity of road network and the randomness of evacuees’ distribution. Therefore, more efforts are needed to explore the possibility of further improving the process. And factors about residents that will affect their speed, like age, gender and road condition should be considered in the future work.||

Implementation of a project is a complex process and requires completion of a host of tasks. The implementation process has been deconstructed into its components so that it can be analysed and evaluated. A prerequisite for implementation is an operational plan. The tasks that require completion include: (1) reassessing current status and verifying the needs; (2) activating the operational plan; (3) setting-up and operating an administrative structure; (4) identifying, acquiring, and organising resources (including human resources); (5) assigning roles and responsibilities; (6) educating and training personnel (including mission-specific); (7) briefing staff; (8) preparing/readying resources for transport; (9) assuring project self-sufficiency; (10) arranging for personal necessities; (11) ensuring the safety of personnel and the security of equipment and supplies; (12) insuring personnel; (13) coordinating with other projects/actors; (14) coordinating with other BSF systems (role of the coordination and control centre); (15) communicating with community leaders; (16) initiating the use of standardised progress reports; (17) deploying personnel, equipment, and supplies; (18) initiating the intervention(s); (19) executing the intervention(s); (20) reporting start of interventions; (21) completing the project; and (22) completing and submitting a formal report. This deconstruction is essential in order to study the process and identify critical points of success and failure. It also is recognised that many interventions consist of many components (subfunctions), each of which may be considered a production process.

Two of them will possibly influence national procedures, but for sure they will influence countermeasure simulation approaches: 1. The concept of a ""reference level"" for emergency and existing controllable exposure situations that represents the level of dose or risk, above which it is judged to be inappropriate to plan to allow exposures to occur, and for which therefore protective actions should be planned in advance. 2. When deciding on the optimum course of protective actions, all exposure pathways and all relevant actions have to be taken into account. The major changes for the simulation models result from the second recommendation that all exposure pathways must be considered when deciding on protective actions. So far all countermeasure simulations in the early phase of an emergency are carried out by considering individual countermeasures such as sheltering or evacuation, if some dose limit for the respective action is exceeded. This approach has to be changed and strategies of several countermeasures analysed and simulated with the ultimate goal not to exceed the reference level over a given time period, typically one year.

Raskob, C. LandmanComments: The article is about implementation of the recommendations of an international commission on radiological protection. The research area of the article is radiology. The article talks about the correct residual dose and protective actions including sheltering, evacuation and distribution of stable iodine tablets etc. The keywords exist in the article but for a totally different issue. Although, the article cannot be applied directly in Dirver+ trials, it is interesting, as it provides a methodological aspect for applying international recommendations in the national/local context. The formation of research questions provide a good example. The main challenges mentioned in the article exist in Driver+ trials as well, such as being comprehensive in implementation and including all exposure pathways in one simulation model exist in Driver+ trials as well.

Is the “residual dose” the right target for decision making?2. Should the new models support the use of operational intervention levels(OILs) and emergency action levels (EALs) as trigger levels for initiating a countermeasure strategy.3. Is there a possibility to stay with the individual intervention levels but optimize them in advance that they fit to the reference level?4. Is the distribution of iodine tablets a single measure with its own criterion or part of a strategy?5. Is there a need to have more than one reference level, dependent on the threat?6. How to define the dose criteria for the lifting of measures?7. Is the dose from food part of the simulation strategy or should a dose fromfood consumption of 5 mSv be assumed as maximum related to the current maximum concentration levels in food?|N/A|Multi organizations group meeting and discussion previously defined research questions|ICRP recommendations Publications 103, 109 and 111 (ICRP, 2007; ICRP 2009a, 2009b)|N/A|N/A|N/A|Consensus was reached, that OILs and EALs are important for the operational community, in particular for the fast decision making in case of an emergency. As these values do not exist at the moment, it was requested, that the new models should be applicable to derive such values based on scenario calculations.It was also agreed that the contribution of the foodchain should be considered together with all the other exposure pathways. This implies that information about consumption habits and about critical groups can be used for the calculations. There was no agreement so far related to the problem of lifting of early phase countermeasures and the dose that is used to derive the reference value or the residual dose. In particular how to calculate the projected residual dose is still an open question. Some organisations favour the potential dose not taking credit for the normal living, whereas others opt for the usage of the best estimate which includes normal living conditions and no critical groups for the ingestion pathways.|A further challenge can be seen in the request to optimise countermeasures with time. Optimisation was always part of any recommendation but so far never realised in simulation models nor described in detail how to be realised in the decision making process.Key challenges for the new models are:• Include all exposure pathways in a consistent way in one simulation model.• Provide a flexibility that allows assessing different potential threat scenarios to derive OILs and EALs.• Provide a methodological approach and guidance to optimize late phase countermeasures such as decontamination and ingestion.• Usability of the new models should not be lost due to a more comprehensive modelling.||

Subsequently, a multi-agent model is developed in Repast platform in Java language, and simulation and analysis are also made.It is assumed that a city’s transport system contains only three nodes: bus station, railway station and airport. At same time, passengers are divided into A, B, C categories according to their acceptable degree in terms of the expenses and time. Category A passengers represent laborers, who pay more attention to economic cost and less sensitive to the time cost; category C people are businesspersons, who tend to put emphasis on the time cost; and category B passengers represent other populations. While some passengers are transported out of the system at transport nodes according to their transport capacity, other passengers are moving into the transport nodes with a certain distribution rate of passenger type. The transferring decisions of stranded passengers will lead to the changes of the distribution of passengers in three transport nodes, thereby affect the efficiency of the whole system. The paper studies the decision-making process of the transfer of the stranded passengers and how this process is affected by group behaviors; develops a multi-agent simulation model; discusses what policies should be implemented in order to transport more stranded passengers out of the system in a given time.|Multi agent simulation model|(1) objective information; weather information, traffic node status (open or closed), the number of stranded passengers at the traffic node and original fare informationat all traffic nodes etc.(2) management information: delay information, refund costs, the number of stranded passengers in other traffic nodes etc.|Multi-agent simulation model of stranded passengers’ transferring decision in Repast (Recursive Porous Agent Simulation Toolkit) is an object-oriented multi-agent modeling tool developed by social science research computing center of university of Chicago, it provides a series of libraries to build, run, display and collect data (North et al., 2006). In Repast environment, users only need to describe the main characteristics of agents and the interaction rules between agents, then a simulation environment can be developed quickly.|The method puts entire system as a complex system in which some agents interact and cooperate. Using a bottom-up approach, the method studies on the adaptive agents, interactions between agents, and the interactions between agent and environment. Multi-agent method links macro perspective and micro perspective organically, through the interactions between agents and environment, it makes changes of individual to become the basis of the changes of whole system, so as to uniformly examine individual behaviors and group behaviors (Davidsson, 2000). A large number of studies have shown that multi-agent method is well suited to be used for complex analysis in the field of economic management and social activities.|No information|The results of simulation show that it is possible to apply the theory of herd behaviors and the multi-agent method in analyzing the effectiveness of government policies on evacuating stranded passengers in climate disasters. The research of this paper has important practical significance for the government to developing policies to evacuating stranded passengers in climate disasters, and is a useful exploration to open up new methodologies for emergency management.The most important indicator of measuring the operational efficiency of the system is the number of passengers to leave the system through traffic nodes in a certain period of time, which means in an efficient system there should be less passengers to give up their trip due to all utilities of their transferring choices (including to stay at the original node) are less than 0.The passengers’ transferring mode without the policy intervention can be summarized as: more passengers tend to move to the bus station because of its lower cost and less number of stranded passengers (even if the space of bus station has reached saturation, its absolute number of stranded passengers is still less than the number of train station), and for businessmen, they will have a greater tendency to regard time as more important decision factor. The system without the policy intervention has poor performance.|Some measures may be help for improving the efficiency of the system, whichinclude canceling refund fee, adjusting the coefficient of temporary ticketing andpromptly publishing circulars when delays or cancellations occur. The system’sefficiency of optimized program is significantly higher than the efficiency ofinitial program.The model and the approach in this paper are useful explorations to open up new methodologies for emergency management. But it should be noted that the problem of stranded passengers’ evacuation in climate disasters also contains some other complex factors, such as the location of traffic nodes, the psychological impact of climate disasters on passengers and so on. How to describe these factors in the model, and how to develop relevant software packages so as to the works of this paper can be better used in practice, are the authors’ effort directions in future researches.||

The following assessment questions were developed to design the evaluation model and data-collection methods:Q1: What were participants’ demographic characteristics?Q2: What were participants’ perceived competences before and after program completion?Q3: Were participants satisfied with faculty, methods, materials, and facilities used?Q4: What were participants’ perceptions of the application of improved competence in exercise evaluation?Q5: After program completion, how were participants assigned or involved in exercise evaluation?Identical pre- and post-program data-collection methods were used to evaluate the CM and TTM. Participant numbers and data collected were insufficient to perform adequate analysis of the TTM.MDHSS and MHA partner interviews were conducted in October 2009 to determine the number of EETP graduates assigned as exercise evaluators. Healthcare and public health partners responsible for exercise implementation and evaluation were asked for a list of EETP-assigned evaluators as an impact measure for mobilization of EETP graduates as qualified exercise evaluators.|Qualitative and quantitative data collection, Interviews||A rolling, open-ended, continuous- improvement approach was used to evaluate findings at each stage or phase of the project. Qualitative and quantitative data-collection methods and procedures remained unchanged throughout CM implementation to enhance ability to produce inferences that adequately answered evaluation questions.Survey Monkey (www.surveymonkey.com) online data-collection and analysis functions were also used.Multiple procedures and information sources were used to assess important project variables, improve consistency of findings (reliability), and improve inferences drawn from the combination of data sources (validity) to answer evaluation questions. In general, consistent stakeholder involvement was critical to address needs, assure credibility, and gain acceptance of evaluation methods and findings. Resource limitations prevented a more robust evaluation that included a range of methods to infer causation. The addition of project phases that documented participants’ pre- and post-program EETP CM knowledge and performance improvement as exercise evaluators could assure a higher level of certainty regarding outcomes associated with completion of the EETP modules.|The following five assessment procedures (with question code labels) were used:• A participant demographic assessment instrument (Q1);• Pre- and post-program participant competence assessment instruments (Q2);• A post-program process evaluation instrument (Q3);• A post-program participant retrospective assessment instrument (Q4); and• A post-program interview and collection of related documents from practice partners who coordinate exercise evaluation (Q5).In addition, HCPHP produced post-program summary evaluation reports, as well as feedback and discussion regarding participants’ performance, program quality, and project management, which were submitted for ongoing faculty and stakeholder review.|The demographic, pre and post-program competence assessment, and process evaluation instruments were completed anonymously, coded, and paired for analysis using each participant’s entry of a four-digit code. |In 2007, MDHSS, MHA, and HCPHP expanded collaboration to support development of the EETP model, a workforce improvement program to rapidly increase competence and capacity of exercise evaluators in Missouri and the Heartland Region. The project is being implemented in several stages: a beta test of the CM and TTM, implementation of the CM across the state of Missouri, and a presentation of the CM and TTM for Kansas and Kentucky partners. Evaluation of the EETP CM provided evidence of participant perceived improved competence (increased capacity) to perform as exercise evaluators throughout Missouri. Overall project activities supported existing FEMA and HSEEP guidance in exercise evaluation and capability improvement, as well as development of a competency-based preparedness core curriculum.|The demand for competent exercise evaluators required partners to accelerate all implementation stages. High interest in registration for onsite programs offered at convenient locations can be dramatically curtailed by recurrent and high-consequence emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Availability of program faculty who possessed in-depth understanding of federal guidance regarding exercise design and evaluation was crucial. Faculty were able to quickly revise and adapt curriculum based on participants’ needs and competence levels, group dynamics, interpretation of new guidance, participant feedback, and evaluation reports. Because group discussion, interactive exercises, and hands-on practice are important to improve performance of exercise evaluators, offering onsite programs, such as the EETP CM, is essential to support online courses such as IS-130. Additional support for post-program evaluation of participants’ performance as exercise evaluators would provide a higher level of certainty and causation of program impact and outcomes.||

The simulation tool adopts the multi-agent paradigm, so as to facilitate the modelling of diverse and autonomous agents, and it provides mechanisms for the interaction of the entities that are being simulated. It operates in a distributed fashion to reduce the simulation time required for such large-scale systems. The simulation tool represents the individuals that need to be evacuated, the resources that contribute to the evacuation including human rescuers, and other active resources and entities which may include robots and which can autonomously interact with the environment and with each other and take individual or collaborative decisions.

Distributed Building Evacuation Simulator (DBES) is a scenario for emergency management based on agent based simulation through two types of agents “simulators” and “simulated agents”. The simulation scenario can be broken down in smaller ones and can be assigned an individual simulator. CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives Overall purpose not indicated in the paper, but the purpose of the simulation is indicated as follows:Functionality/purpose: The entities participating in the simulation have different functionalities. For instance, a possible evacuation scenario involves civilians who wish to evacuate the building and reach predefined collection points. At any time, they select their next actions so that they move towards the closest exit. In addition, robot agents who search for civilians inside the building could also be present.|Overall purpose not indicated in the paper, but the purpose of the simulation is indicated as follows:Functionality/purpose: The entities participating in the simulation have different functionalities. For instance, a possible evacuation scenario involves civilians who wish to evacuate the building and reach predefined collection points. At any time, they select their next actions so that they move towards the closest exit. In addition, robot agents who search for civilians inside the building could also be present.|Not indicated |The DBES presented in this paper is a tool that simulates emergency response scenarios taking place inside buildings. It is built on top of the JADE platform, following the multiagent paradigm, modelling all simulated entities as dedicated agents. These entities are able to interact with, search for and subscribe to one another. The communication between them is done using a well-defined communication ontology and all interactions follow the FIPA standards.State: The state of each entity is reflected by its location, health level and goal, which is considered to be a specific node of the graph. As the simulation evolves, these parameters are affected by the environmental conditions, for example the hazard of a room in the case of a fire. This information is private to the agent itself, but can be forwarded to the simulator as well, for visualization reasons, or to extract statistical information.World perspective: Each entity has its own world perspective, which initially is an estimate of the overall graph model for the whole simulated area. As the simulation evolves and the entities traverse the graph, they update their internal perspective with more upto-date information about the area in the agent’s proximity. This updated view is the basis for their next decisions.Behavioural model: Our entities maintain a behavioural model which comprises mobility and health behaviours. In our simulations we consider that these models pertain to moving speeds and how any form of danger affects the health of the agent.|Agent based simulation||Through two types of agents: simulators and simulated agents. The simulated agents are active agents that implement a specific strategy, such as evacuating a building by going to the nearest exit, searching for other agents in a building or locating and transporting agents to the exit. Each strategy is private to the agent itself and at every point in time, it determines the agent’s next action. Each action is modelled by an event, which is described by a time-stamp and the event description such as event: = _t, type_. Simulators on the other hand are a different type of agents. They are passive in terms of how they affect the simulation evolution. Their main task is to receive a list of events that each agent is committed to simulate in the upcoming future, sort them in an ascending order of time-stamp and trigger the appropriate agent when it is its time to make the next action. Prior to be notified, each agent receives information about its line of sight, so as to be able to determine if its action is feasible or not. After determining the output of its strategy, the agent notifies the simulator which in turn makes a final validity check about the agent’s new state. The component that is responsible for the ordering of the events and determining the next agent to be triggered is the simulation engine. Using DBES, a simulation scenario can be broken down in smaller ones and can be assigned an individual simulator.|The information exchange between agents is completely based upon a specific communication ontology in order to ensure that the semantic content of tokens is preserved across agents. Distributed development of multiple agents and the necessity to understand each other increase the importance of a common semantic concept. Together with a FIPA-compliant implementation of the agent communication and an agent coordination mechanism, the communication ontology forms a sophisticated technique for the collaboration among agents.|Not indicated |The simulation tool represents the individuals that need to be evacuated, the resources that contribute to the evacuation including human rescuers, and other active resources and entities which may include robots and which can autonomously interact with the environment and with each other and take individual or collaborative decisions. The tool is illustrated with an application and the results are compared for both centralized and distributed execution. The results show the significant reduction in execution time that is achieved for different degrees of distribution of the simulator on multiple servers. |The incorporation of richer user interfaces, and techniques to improve the performance of the simulation scenario will be investigated by identifying ‘short-cuts’ in the simulated events.||
2583|WEB-DESIGN EVALUATION OF THE CRISIS MAP OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC USING EYE-TRACKING.|Brychtova, Alzbeta ; Paszto, Vit ; Marek, Lukas ; Panek, Jiri|2013|CRISIS management;EYE movements;HUMANITARIANISM;DETECTORS;CZECH Republic;Cartography;Collaborative Mapping;Eye Movement Patterns;Eye-tracking;User Interface|Crisis Mapping is a proper part of Crisis Informatics and Collaboration. This has come about mainly as a response to the major disasters of the last decade. Crisis Mapping has become a strong and effective tool for humanitarian workers especially after the Haiti earthquake of 2010. During the major floods in 2010 Czech Television used for the very first time social networks to involve thousands of citizens as sensors of the current state of affairs. Since that experience Czech Television started experimenting with creating its own crisis map. These experiments resulted in The Crisis Map of the Czech Republic. Since The Crisis Map is solely web-based and social media oriented, the crucial point was to design, programe and set-up the website itself. For this purpose, cognitive methods of user issues evaluation were used - namely eye-tracking technology. Eye-tracking technology is based on the principles of tracking movements of human eye while perceiving the visual scene. Recoding eye movements does not rely on self-reporting, therefore it can be considered as an objective method and can enhance traditional methods of evaluating user interfaces. Eye movement analysis provides valuable quantitative and qualitative information on visual search strategies of users. The main goal of the paper is to evaluate The Crisis Map website design to achieve maximal efficiency of manipulating and reporting user needs during crisis events. In total, 8 volunteers were asked to participate in the eye-tracking experiment. Based on the results of this study the website administrators were able to improve overall interface of The Crisis Map, which is now ready to use.

Based on the results of this study the website administrators were able to improve overall interface of The Crisis Map, which is now ready to use.|Participatory approach (Direct involvement of volunteers to track the eye movement).||Collaborative mapping that is context and issue driven rather than technology-led and seek to emphasize community involvement in the production and/or use of geographical information.Participants had to complete following tasks over web page environment of The Crisis Map: - to report an accident or crisis situation, - to find information about crisis situations nearby a given location, - to find special needs within a location of a crisis situation.|All experimental tasks were evaluated separately. Due to the fact that stimuli are of different types (static image and interactive web pages), different approaches of analysis were applied on eye-tracking data.Task 1 - Look over the Main Page of the Crisis Map The objective of the task was to reveal whether the most important parts of the map interface attract user attention at first sight.Task 2 - Report an accident The objective of the task was to find out the easiness of the task to report the crisis event and inform other people and media about it via The Crisis Map interface. For this purpose the special button (feature 04-report AOI in Fig. 3) with the hyperlink to the reporting form was designed. Eye-movement data was used to find out the moment when the user visually found the button for the first time, when he or she used it (pushed it with the mouse click, see Table 1) and how was the strategy to find the form.Task 3 - Find information about crisis situations This task had the purpose to show the usability of The Crisis Map when finding information about existing crisis situations.Task 4 - Find special needs This task was focused on the usability of searching within The Crisis Map environment. The question was to find where is the need of the medical assistance on the highway D1|Participation in the experiment was completely anonymous. Respondents were not asked about their gender or expertise.| Task 1: Participants had no task to solve; they only had to explore the environment. Shorter fixation duration could indicate that the meaning of the map was understood easily than other parts of the page.Task 2:The majority of participants did not understand the purpose of the reporting button when they saw it for the first time. Moreover, most of them hit it by gaze more than once time before they used it. Two participants found different way how to report the event (via feature 10-help AOI in Fig. 3). All participants first tried to report via the map window (feature 03-map AOI in Fig. 3) before they found that there is no possibility to do it. Time to solve the task varies from 13 to 141 seconds.Task 3:Time to solve the task varies from 4 to 62 seconds. One half of participants used intuitively the map window as the first option to find the Liberec city and events that happened here. Other participants were using and looking at different controls of the web page, which slowed them down.Task 4:Time to answer varies from 10 to 30 seconds. Only three users were using different way to find the desired information, than it was intendedIn this study the evaluation of eye-tracking data was used to determine how users utilize the web interface controls of The Crisis Map while solving tasks for which the map was designed and to detect trouble spots. It was found that some parts of the map interface are not designed precisely, so that users are absolutely aware of their purpose. |The finding based on simple analyses could help to optimize the design and increase the usability of The Crisis Map in future.||
2595|A new hybrid evolutionary based RBF networks method for forecasting time series: A case study of forecasting emergency supply demand time series.|Mohammadi, Reza ; Fatemi Ghomi, S.M.T. ; Zeinali, Farzad|2014|HYBRID systems;EVOLUTIONARY algorithms;RADIAL basis functions;NEURAL networks (Computer science);EMERGENCY management;PARTICLE swarm optimization;Demand forecasting;Evolutionary algorithms;Natural disaster;Radial basis function networks;Time series prediction|Improving time series forecasting accuracy has received considerable attention in recent years. This paper presents a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm for determining both architecture (input variables and neurons of hidden layer) and network parameters (centers, width and weights) of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) simultaneously. Our proposed algorithm generates new architecture applying genetic algorithm (GA). Modified adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) is used to determine the training parameters efficiently. Inertia weight and acceleration coefficients in APSO are adapted by swarm status. Since PSO algorithms suffer premature convergence, especially when global best is found, mutation operator is applied to overcome the drawback. Comparing the performance of the proposed approach with several benchmark time series modeling and algorithms shows that the proposed method is able to predict time series more accurately than others. Finally, proposed GAÃ¢â‚¬â€œAPSO based RBFNNs method is applied to predict the demand of emergency supplies after earthquake in the East Azerbayjan in 2012 in Iran. The results show that the proposed evolving RBF based method can be applied to forecast the emergency supply demand time series successfully with the automatically selected nodes and inputs.

The traffic network is composed of 422 intersections and 2881 directional links. As to verify the methods proposed by this paper, the traffic network is divided into five traffic signal control regions, and the five regions traffic signal control systems form eight intraregional boundaries.|Computer simulation, Synchro V6, integrated development environment (IDE) and visual component library (VCL) of Delphi 7.0, MapX 4.5, and Oracle 9i, the interregional traffic signal coordination and control softwareis released, named as URSC|Operation time of coordination, traffic signal optimization|Simulation input data come from loop coils vehicle detectors and video cameras vehicle detectors in July 14 to 27, 2007.The interval of data collection is 5 minutes. These detectors collect traffic parameters including traffic flow volume, speed, and occupancy rate. As to simulate the influence on traffic network in sudden disaster, this paper uses random disturbance factor to randomly reduce road capacity of the traffic network [16]. And this paper defines the threshold value that an intersection needs to be subdivided from the intraregional boundaries intersection group as 𝛿1 = 0.45. And the threshold value that an intersection should be  consolidated into the intraregional boundaries intersection group is 𝛿2 = 0.75. The verification work was done as the following procedure.|Step 1. Input the traffic network and traffic flow data into Synchro V6 signal optimization software and obtain traffic signal control parameters of every signalized intersection in the traffic network output by Synchro V6.Step 2. With microscopic simulation software Paramics V6, Paramics V6 simulator inputs traffic flow data using the data obtained from loop coils vehicle detectors and video cameras vehicle detectors. Step 3: Develop the interregional traffic signal strategic coordination and control algorithm in [17]. With the integrated development environment (IDE) and visual component library (VCL) of Delphi 7.0, MapX 4.5, and Oracle 9i, the interregional traffic signal coordination and control software is released, named as URSC. Paramics V6 simulation signal control plans are replaced by the signal control parameters output from URSC. Then run the Paramics V6 simulation to get the intraregional boundaries traffic flow performance indices which are defined as RP.Step 4.

Paramics V6 simulation signal control plans are replaced by the signal control parameters output from UBSC. Then run the Paramics V6 simulation to get the intraregional boundaries traffic flow performance indices that are defined as BP. Step 5. Compare the performance indices of SP, RP, and BP.More information can be found in pp 7-9.|Not indicated |Simulation was done under the conditions that disaster affected traffic flow volumes are 30,000, 50,000, and 100,000, respectively. Simulator is running with and without the intraregional boundaries traffic signal coordination strategy. Each case runs three times, every time running 7,200 seconds in simulator. Then get the data to analyze the relationship between evacuation time and evacuation volume of traffic flow. From the simulation results, as the more the traffic flow volume trapped in sudden disaster is, the more the capacity of road in traffic network damage is and the higher the degree of traffic flow burden in traffic network is. The evacuation time is growing with the exponential trend. Under the traffic flow volumes are 30,000, 50,000, and 100,000 in disaster affected region, with intraregional boundaries traffic signal coordination strategy being able to reduce about 13.06%, 15.22%, and 20.16% evacuation time, respectively, compared to without intraregional boundaries traffic signal coordination strategy.| When the system uses interregional traffic signal strategic coordination and intraregional boundaries traffic signal coordination together, it can obviously improve the traffic network performance, that is, traffic network performance efficiency promotes more than 30% in congestion traffic flow status, and can rapidly evacuate the traffic flow in disaster affected region.||

If the frequency and severity continue or increase, adaptation and mitigation efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations and improve daily life under changed weather conditions. This field report examines the devastation due to Hurricane Sandy experienced in Red Hook, Brooklyn, New York, a neighborhood consisting of geographically isolated low-lying commercial and residential units, with a concentration of low-income housing, and disproportionate rates of poverty and poor health outcomes largely experienced by Black and Latino residents. Multiple sources of data were reviewed, including street canvasses, governmental reports, community flyers, and meeting transcripts, as well as firsthand observations by a local nonprofit Red Hook Initiative (RHI) and community members, and social media accounts of the effects of Sandy and the response to daily needs. These data are considered within existing theory, evidence, and practice on protecting public health during extreme weather events. Firsthand observations show that a community-based organization in Red Hook, RHI, was at the center of the response to disaster relief, despite the lack of staff training in response to events such as Hurricane Sandy. Review of these data underscores that adaptation and response to climate change and likely resultant extreme weather is a dynamic process requiring an official coordinated governmental response along with on-the-ground volunteer community responders.

Does not follow the criteria given in the table below, as it does not depend on an experiment/exercise or simulation. The paper reports some issues regarding the community response to Sandy Hurricane and lists further questions at the end to improve the current response level to disasters.

RHI served as an information and service anchor in the aftermath of Sandy. Data sources for this report include two separate firsthand accounts from a RHI staff person and a board member who were on the ground during the event and well known in the community before Sandy. In addition, to triangulate data, the following were reviewed: minutes from four community meetings before utilities were restored in Red Hook, personal texts which provided a timeline of events, and finally, social media including the Twitter feeds and Facebook posts of the Red Hook Initiative and a New York City Council member.|||Despite a mandatory evacuation order for Red Hook, many residents did not leave since Hurricane Irene’s minimal impact, the year prior, provided a false sense of security. Additionally, residents conveyed they feared, “they may not be allowed back in once they were evacuated.”The only health clinic in the neighborhood was flooded; clinic staff, nurses, and doctors were evacuated.Running water, electricity, and heat were restored at different periods in Red Hook. After 11 days, running water was restored, during which time, residents had to leave their homes for food and drinking water and could not flush their toilets. Electricity was not fully restored to most of the Red Hook Houses until 3 weeks after Sandy landed, including the period when NYCHA preemptively shut down electricity before Sandy made landfall to prevent additional damage and the possibility of fires when the storm arrived. Some residents experienced intermittent electrical outages through the remainder of the year. Volunteers and RHI staff canvassed the Red Hook Houses to tabulate where utilities were restored. Occasionally, this information conflicted with the official NYC estimation broadcasted by local news media. The lack of communication about utilities and progress to restore them was frustrating to residents, some of whom voiced their despair at community meetings with public officials. There was no heat for Red Hook Houses residents for 17 days, between October 30 and  November 15, during which time the city faced average temperatures in the mid-40s (degrees Fahrenheit) and a winter Nor’easter a week after Sandy. One benefit of geographic isolation is the opportunity for community stakeholders to establish and maintain strong social networks and have a profound understanding of the inner workings of the community. High social capital within the neighborhood that might not be replicable in other vulnerable communities contributed to Red Hook’s resiliency in the weeks after Hurricane Sandy landed.|Future plans need to include meaningful community input to develop a bottom–up and realistic approach to planning for the next natural disaster. While RHI, a social service agency with no disaster response training, was able to assemble a response and relief effort akin to a CERT program, there should be an officially trained front-line team organized by government officials capable of responding to emergency situations. Preparedness efforts should include engaging organizations from vulnerable communities prior to extreme weather events, to recruit and train individuals who can serve on these teams in an official capacity.Is it possible that measures in the form of generators or additional power and water alternatives taken near low-lying areas prior to the storm could improve recovery and relieve the stress placed on this and other geographically vulnerable communities?Are there particular measures and resources that can be made available in public housing to protect low-income residents?Mandatory evacuation as a policy needs to be reanalyzed as well. For example, Will transportation be provided?Will special needs populations have sufficient care at shelters? How long can a shelter maintain a displaced population?What is needed to encourage relocation and reintegration?Contingency plans must be in place, especially in large housing developments like the Red Hook Houses, and accessible to the community to quickly and efficiently address critical infrastructure issues. Transporting portable facilities 9 days after Sandy landed is far too long to leave any urban population without access to proper sanitation. Closure of the only clinic in Red Hook highlights a need for clinics to have emergency preparedness plans. These plans could include staff assignments, generators on site to support community recovery for routine nonemergency medical needs, and identifying alternate locations if clinics are in low-lying areas. With some effort, response to extreme weather events will resemble other rapid responses from emergency services, such as EMTs and the fire department the public have come to rely on.||
2611|Assessing Public Health Capabilities During Emergency Preparedness Tabletop Exercises: Reliability and Validity of a Measurement Tool.|Savoia, Elena ; Testa, Marcia A. ; Biddinger, Paul D. ; Cadigan, Rebecca O. ; Koh, Howard ; Campbell, Paul ; Stoto, Michael A.|2009|PUBLIC health administration;EVALUATION;PUBLIC officers -- Training of;PERFORMANCE evaluation;EMERGENCY management;PREVENTIVE medicine;PUBLIC health|Objectives. Improving the ability of local public health agencies to respond to large-scale emergencies is an ongoing challenge. Tabletop exercises can provide an opportunity for individuals and groups to practice coordination of emergency response and evaluate performance. The purpose of this study was to develop a valid and reliable self-assessment performance measurement tool for tabletop exercise participants. Methods. The study population comprised 179 public officials who attended three tabletop exercises in Massachusetts and Maine between September 2005 and November 2006. A 42-item questionnaire was developed to assess five public health functional capabilities: (1) leadership and management, (2) mass casualty care, (3) communication, (4) disease control and prevention, and (5) surveillance and epidemiology. Analyses were undertaken to examine internal consistency, associations among scales, the empirical structure of the items, and inter-rater agreement. Results. Thirty-seven questions were retained in the final questionnaire and grouped according to the original five domains. Alpha coefficients were 0.81 or higher for all scales. The five-factor solution from the principal components analysis accounted for 60% of the total variance, and the factor structure was consistent with the five domains of the original conceptual model. Inter-rater agreement ranged from good to excellent. Conclusions. The resulting 37-item performance measurement tool was found to reliably measure public health functional capabilities in a tabletop exercise setting, with preliminary evidence of a factor structure consistent with the original conceptualization and of criterion-related validity.

Each subject attended one of three regional tabletop exercises held in Massachusetts and Maine between September 2005 and November 2006. Participants included local, regional, and state-level professionals from a variety of disciplines such as public health, health care, law enforcement, fire services, emergency medical services, emergency management, and government. Exercises held in Massachusetts were planned in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as well as with selected coalitions of local health departments and boards of health. Exercises held in Maine were planned in collaboration with the Maine Regional Resource Centers for Emergency Preparedness. Exercises were organized by preparedness region in Massachusetts and by county in Maine.For each exercise, participants were strategically assigned to interdisciplinary groups of eight to 12 people from the same or neighboring municipalities.

Internal consistency of multiitem scales (questions within the same domain) was calculated by means of Cronbach’s alpha. Correlations were determined by Pearson’s product moment coefficient. The co-linearity of the inter-correlation matrix was tested using Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity and by Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy. The empirical structure of the scales was determined by principal components analysis. The Kaiser-Guttman rule (eigenvalue .1) and the corresponding screen plot results were used to determine the number of factors to be retained. Factors were rotated using varimax rotation. The factor scores were computed as the linear combination of the product of the standardized score and its factor loading.

Design - The model was operationalised and tested on leaders (n=385) from the ambulance service, the police force, and the rescue services in Sweden. A questionnaire was operationalised from the codes and categories of the previously developed model. Findings - The study showed that the most important factors in explaining the outcome of complex rescue operations were organisational climate before the incident, positive stress reactions, and personal knowledge of the co-actors during the episode. Cases where the leader appraised that the situation could not be resolved with the available resources were characterised by less favourable ratings, irrespective of whether humans were perceived as being threatened or not. The strength of this controllability aspect was interpreted in terms of a professional action-oriented identity. Research limitations/implications - The results were affected by a high dropout rate and the fact that there were comparatively few large-scale rescue operations. Practical implications - The results may be valuable in both training and exercises with rescue operation commanders. Originality/value - The paper presents a validation of a new, integrative, theoretical process model of leadership in complex, stressful rescue operations.

For better understanding the needs of the participants in the trial, and their daily working routine, a questionnaire can be conducted, as it was done in this article for another purpose.

Field sites were selected to represent high landslide risk situations, yet different land use histories and ethnic compositions. Finally, 168 household surveys were conducted, constituting approximately 50 percent of each village or neighborhood, based on purposeful sampling of households to ensure that households within a perimeter of 100 meters from the landslides or flood-affected zones were questioned. Each household surveyed was geo-referenced using a Geographic Positioning System and located on a high-resolution satellite image from which risk maps were created. Results from the household survey were tabulated in excel tables and open-ended questions were analyzed manually.|There are 50 indicators of resilience, modified from the five capitals developed by the sustainable livelihoods approach (Natural, Economic, Social, Human and Physical) and validated through community consultations. Values for each indicator were obtained from the household survey questionnaires. Each indicator received a score from 0 to 3, zero being low resilience to three high resilience, consistent with the approach proposed by Kafle (2011). Each of the five resource categories has ten indicators, carrying equal weight, a choice that was made through the participatory process. As the indicator development approach was participatory, a principal component analysis statistical test was not conducted, possibly leading to an overlap in indicators from a statistical viewpoint, something that could be rectified in future research. Likewise, more participatory field testing in different settings will also help to validate and correct the choice of indicators. Thus the maximum resilience score for each household was 150.|No information |What the research results demonstrate is a relatively straightforward and simple means for obtaining data on the state of a community’s resilience as a relatively simple “snapshot” of resilience at one period in time, assuming that resilience is an outcome that can be improved over time with the “right” set of interventions.

If resilience is to become a useful paradigm, then root causes of risk and vulnerability must be included in its definition and only then can resilience be a useful attribute and a valuable decision-making tool for sustainable development and risk reduction interventions.Membership in social organizations was an important factor in most of the villages surveyed.The indicators which had the greatest influence on resilience by order of importance as measured by scores obtained for each indicator:ethnic status ( percent advantaged population);skills training;economic: employment and remittances;disaster management committee;early warning system, monitoring:community leadership;CFUGs;structural hazard protection;health care; andaccess to roads.|The main limitation of this research is that it focussed mainly on outcome indicators; although some process indicators of resilience were identified (i.e. grazing management practices, skills training, organizational skills and learning through education), these need to be more comprehensive and validated through community consultations. Process indicators refer to ability for learning from past experiences, flexibility, early warning and monitoring, risk reduction planning, but can also include ecosystem based processes such as land use management practices, water management, diversification of resources, etc. Examples include:. sustainable land management: community forest and grazing management forhazard protection, erosion control and improved water quality and quantity;. community leadership training;. women’s savings groups;. income diversification;. water quality and quantity;. access to information;. in all cases, special effort to involve women’s and minority groups; and. project flexibility and ability for learning.Further research in this field would also need to focus more on identifying the underlying risk factors, institutional issues, power relations and learning processes.||

It can be run in a Monte-Carlo fashion for risk analysis, with multiple alternative scenarios for the development of the fire after ignition time generated from a set of initial conditions. The model predicts what the sensor measurements will be for given  input conditions (for example, fire location, item properties, and doors open and closed) and compares its initial predictions to the real data collected from sensors. Using a procedure based (in part) on Bayesian inference, the model adjusts its parametric space from which new scenarios are generated, thereby identifying fire scenarios that are progressively better matches to the sensor readings.The experiment demonstrated that the proposed architecture is capable of providing real-time decision making information and it therefore fulfilled its primary objectives.The various technical components were integrated seamlessly, which can be described from the following aspects: The latest sensor measurements were relayed rapidly via simple interpretative models to the end user, to inform of any current hazards.The sensor data was consumed and assimilated by the KCRISP predictive simulation model. The model adapted to the evolving sensor measurements and predicted hazard conditions, encompassing both fire exposures and structural integrity, which were fully consistent with the range of possible outcomes exhibited by the actual fire.Access to the HPC resources through the Grid proceeded without any delay, which ensured that prediction results were generated and delivered in good time (that is, while they were still considerable `actionable' predictions).The C3I has provided a succinct interface for Incident Commanders using a `traffic light' display to convey hazard information in an accessible manner, supplemented with underlying rationale and advice, and designed to integrate into the operational decision-making processes.|||

This paper aims to argue that a uniform response by numerous government agencies in South Africa can only be achieved through the application of an accepted model, which is based on the requirements of the Disaster Management Act 57 of 2002 as well as the National Disaster Risk Management Framework of South Africa. Design/methodology/approach - The model was developed using grounded theory methodology through the use of the internet and focus group interviews with South African as well as international experts. During the process of analysing the data by open and axial coding, key elements emerged which were then clustered into categories from which the core concepts of the model emerged. The emergent core concepts were then dimensionalised, which formed the major constructs of the model thereby ensuring that the model was grounded in the theory. Constant comparisons were drawn with the experiences in the field throughout the process in order to ensure theoretical sensitivity. During the process of axial coding certain intervening conditions emerged which could negatively or positively affect its application. The developed model was therefore subjected to scrutiny by means of a quantitative attitudinal test amongst senior professionals involved in the field of emergency and disaster management, resulting in triangulation. Findings - The findings demonstrate that in order for the proposed model to be implemented effectively it is necessary to refine each level of response in terms of authority, communication and reporting lines. Originality/value - This model can be used as the foundation for the development of a comprehensive response management system for South Africa and other similar countries, and that the model can further contribute to the development of a basic training module for inclusion in the curricula of response agency personnel.

The scope of management applied in a level one response is that of vertical command and decision-making, exercised by the Agency Commander over own agency resources from an Agency Command Post (ACP).Level two responseA level two response applies to an incident demanding the response of the primary agency, which has statutory responsibilities to deal with the primary effects of the incident; and support agencies from other disciplines within the same jurisdiction, which have statutory responsibility to deal with the secondary effects of the incident. The span of management applied in a level two response is that of horizontal coordination and decision-making exercised by the Incident Coordinator (IC) who establishes an Incident Coordination Post (ICP).Level three responseA level three response constitutes a response involving multiple agencies to an incident, the magnitude of which, demands resources in excess of the available own resource thresholds of any single agency which has statutory responsibility to deal with the primary or secondary effects of the incident. Such a response would therefore demand human, equipment or organisational capabilities and/or decision-making which exceed local capacity to the extent that it requires the engagement of either executive decision making, resources from outside of jurisdictional boundaries, or powers to invoke extraordinary measures. Such an escalation can also be classified as a local disaster and where necessary declared as a municipal state of disaster (South Africa (Republic), 2003). The span of management applied in a level three response is that of horizontal coordination and decision-making, exercised from the Joint Operations Centre (JOC), which is established by the JOC Coordinator.Level four responseA level four response applies to a single occurrence of such magnitude that it demands human, equipment or organisational capabilities and/or decision making which exceeds local capacity. It can also be a series of Level three response operations taking place simultaneously in the jurisdiction of a single local municipality, in multiple local municipalities within the jurisdiction of a district municipality, or a metropolitan municipality. Such a response can accordingly be classified as a local disaster and where necessary declared as a local state of disaster (South Africa (Republic), 2003). The span of management applied in a level four response is that of direction spanning horizontally across jurisdictional boundaries; executive decision making; invoking extraordinary statutory powers necessary to deal effectively with the situation and is exercised by the Head of the Municipal Disaster Management Centre supported by the Disaster Direction Team from the Disaster Operations Centre (DOC) within the MDMC.Level five responseA level five response applies to an occurrence of such magnitude that it exceeds the statutory and jurisdictional capabilities of a single district or metropolitan municipality to deal with it effectively or a series of Level four response operations taking place simultaneously in the jurisdiction of a province. Such an event can accordingly be classified as a provincial disaster and where necessary declared as provincial state of disaster (South Africa (Republic), 2003). The span of management applied in a level five response is that of direction spanning horizontally across jurisdictional boundaries; executive decision making; invoking extraordinary statutory powers necessary to deal effectively with the situation and is exercised by the Head of the Provincial Disaster Management Centre supported by the Disaster Direction Team from the Disaster Operations Centre.Level six responseA level six response applies to an occurrence of such magnitude that it exceeds the statutory and jurisdictional capabilities of a single province to deal with it effectively or a series of level five response operations taking place simultaneously in the country. Such an event can accordingly be classified as a national disaster and where necessary declared as a national state of disaster. The span of management applied in a level six response is that of direction spanning horizontally across jurisdictional boundaries; executive decision making; invoking extraordinary statutory powers necessary to deal effectively with the situation and is exercised by the Head of the National Disaster Management Centre by the Disaster Direction Team from the Disaster Operations Centre (DOC).|grounded theory methodology, focus group interviews|Incident: preventing and reducing loss of life, injury, disease, damage to property, infrastructure or the environment which may occur as a result of incident Emergency: available capability and resourcesDisaster: the speed of onset, the predictability and origin of the event, the extend of its impact, if it exceeds the capacity of the surviving elements to deal with the consequences using all available resources, extraordinary measures to limit or deal with its effectsLevels of response: predefined parameters or limits in terms of capability, resources and scope of authority.|The model, aims to provide a generic framework on which a comprehensive multi-agency response management system can be developed for South Africa. The model does not strive to provide a system which addresses the intra-disciplinary operating procedures of the individual response agencies which is commonly referred to as an Incident Command System and which clearly should be the subject of a separate study, but focuses on the management of multi-agency responses.|During the process of analysing the data by open and axial coding, key elements emerged which were then clustered into categories from which the core concepts of the model emerged. The emergent core concepts were then dimensionalised, which formed the major constructs of the model thereby ensuring that the model was grounded in the theory.

The most significant concept that emerged from the research was the logic to move away from linking the term “incident” to the title of a system that is designed to provide for graduated levels of managing response across the spectrum of occurrences in respect of magnitude as opposed to response to an incident. In support of this approach, was the fact that the use of the terms “incident” and “disaster” conveyed a “stop, start” context which inhibited the natural escalating management concept. Consequently, the use of a generic term which describes the exact purpose which a system of this nature is designed to serve, was adopted and hence this model is referred to as the “Multi-agency Response Management System” (MARMS).This model can be used as the foundation for the development of a comprehensive response management system for South Africa and other similar countries, and that the model can further contribute to the development of a basic training module for inclusion in the curricula of response agency personnel.|In order for the proposed model to be implemented effectively, it is necessary to refine each level of response in terms of authority, communication and reporting lines.Further refining is necessary for each level of response in terms of the scope of authority; communication; and reporting lines. This can be done through the development of standard operating protocols. Although the MARMS can be used as a foundation for the development of a comprehensive response system for South Africa, the development of a national standard for level one response is fundamental to the further development of this model. The model could contribute to the development of a basic training model for inclusion in the curricula of response agency personnel.||

Specifically, we use a stochastic game formulation of these problems in which tasks have varying hard deadlines and processing requirements. We then introduce a new technique for approximating this game using a series of static potential games, before detailing a decentralized method for solving the approximating games that uses the distributed stochastic algorithm. Finally, we discuss an implementation of our approach to a task allocation problem in the RoboCup Rescue disaster management simulator. The results show that our technique performs comparably to a centralized task scheduler (within 6% on average), and also, unlike its centralized counterpart, it is robust to restrictions on the agentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ communication and observation ranges.

In the limited range scenario, an exploring agent (i.e. a police or fire-brigade) can pass on information to an ambulance only when it is within the communication range, thus representing the limited observation range of the ambulances. Each simulation is 300 time-steps in duration.|They evaluate a two-parameter setting of our method with P = 0.5 and 0.9—OPGA(0.5) and OPGA(0.9)—and a decision window of w = 30 steps for both. The preliminary experiments’ results were not very sensitive to different P values between 0.5 and 0.9, we limited our current results to the two endpoints of this range. The value for w was chosen from preliminary experiments, as it depends on the nature of the domain. To achieve statistical significance (results are shown with 95% confidence intervals), each experiment was run 30 times. The performance in an experiment is reflected by the score obtained at the end of the simulation. This score is a standard provided by the RCR framework and is the sum of the health points of the civilians in the map. The health of an un-rescued civilian decreases with time until it reaches 0 (which, in fact constitutes the deadline), whereas that of a rescued civilian improves with time. The number of civilians saved over time is measured, because it gives an insight into how the rate of rescue is affected by the rate of discovery of casualties.For more information about the experiments please see pp 1470-1475||The authors state that an optimal algorithm would not have satisfied the additional requirements of a control mechanism for the domain, namely robustness and computational tractability (with its consequences for communication use and the timeliness of the solutions generated) as well as optimality. In order to satisfy these requirements, they proposed a technique for approximating a stochastic game using a sequence of overlapping potential games, which are derived from a finite horizon approximation of the global objective function. Importantly, the agents’ utilities are derived in such a way that they do not require complete information about the state of the world or of the actions of other agents in the system, and as such, the technique is robust to communication restrictions.|||

Data were collected from two simulations of a mass casualty incident with bums in a rural area in the mid portion of Sweden close to the Norwegian border, based on a large inventory of emergency resources available in this area as well as regional hospitals, university hospitals and burn centres in Sweden and abroad. The simulation system Emergo Train SystemÃ‚Â® (ETS) was used and risk for preventable death and complications were used as outcome measures: simulation I, 18.5% (n = 13) preventable deaths and 15.5% (n = 11) preventable complications; simulation II, 11.4% (n = 8) preventable deaths and 11.4% (n = 8) preventable complications. The last T1 patient was evacuated after 7 h in simulation I, compared with 5 h in simulation II. Better national coordination of bum care and more timely distribution based on the experience from the first simulation, and possibly a learning effect, led to a better patient outcome in simulation II. The experience using a system that combines both process and outcome indicators can create important results that may support disaster planning.

The plan was based on national laws and regulations for disaster medicine preparedness for peacetime and the regional command and control system for major incidents. One important part of the plan was a designated national point of contact with a mandate to coordinate all burn care and directly convey expert support or patient distribution support to the affected county council concerning burns.Two simulations were conducted. |Simulation exercise|Performance indicators:Assess and evaluate content of alarm Declaration of major incident for regional health care within own region Decision on level of alert for staff Establish contact with burn centre within own region (local level) Establish contact with burn centre in other region Establish contact with affected region Deliver preliminary referrals for burns Decide on inventory; ensure the base information for a more definitive distribution of burnsFormulate general guidelines for national burn response and coordinationCreate basis for first bulletin (internal + external)Assess whether national coordination of ambulance transport resources (EMS + HEMS) needs to be establishedEnsure that there is adequate information for decision on referrals (deliver definitive key for distribution of burns and notify all burn centres) Identify the need for cooperation with other national authorities and international networks based on the burn assessment Create base information for depiction of the national situation|The core of the Emergo Train System1 (ETS) consists of a patient database with specific casualties and typical in-hospital patients that, together with specific staff and other types of resources involved in  emergency/disaster management, can be used to translate local prerequisites into the system. All ETS victims belong to a specific standardized injury category and each victim has a defined medical need within a certain period. The time taken for each measure is calculated according to a defined standard. If a patient’s specific need (e.g. airway intervention, pleural drainage, surgery or intensive care unit (ICU) assessment) is not met within the stipulated period, the patient risks an unfavourable outcome. This risk is expressed by the system as a risk for preventable death or a risk for preventable complications. Thus, at the end of a simulation exercise, it is possible to calculate and summarize patient outcome and relate the result to the treatment given and to other decisions made. The different injury categories have been developed in a consensus process with national experts within the fields of traumatology and disaster medicine and in accordance with evidence-based best practice of trauma care. The specific burn categories have been developed in consensus and collaboration with national burn experts in Australia and Sweden||Not indicated |The result is that timely and accurate response from the regional medical command together with timely response from a national coordination function most likely had a positive impact on patient outcome in simulation II. In addition, the results indicate that a more precise distribution of casualties over short distances to regional hospitals and long distance with HEMS to university hospitals and burn centres can be an advantage. Thus, by timely and specific referrals, the on-scene time was also reduced. Second simulation has better outcome due to three reasons. First, despite the long transport distances, the early mobilization of resources from both the Swedish and Norwegian side of the border made it possible to start transportation to the nearest regional hospitals by ambulances after 45 min. Second, the early mobilization of ambulance helicopters from Norway with both anesthesia physicians and nurses was a factor that probably contributed to these results due to the possibility of performing life-saving airway interventions after 1 h. Third, measurable performance indicators used in simulation II were found by the participants to be applicable and probably stimulated the participants to perform more timely and effective management in simulation IIHowever, despite correct triage at the scene, four patients with blunt head trauma causing expanding intracranial hematoma were identified in the system as risk for preventable death in both simulations. These cases were prioritized as immediate  but did not receive airway intervention within the stipulated period of 1 h. To address this issue, it is important to note that it was the burn perspective that governed much of the simulation and burns were to some extent prioritized for long-distance helicopter transport to the burn centres. Furthermore, the present disaster scenario occurred in a rural area where the early medical needs exceeded the response capabilities. Under such circumstances, without aggressive treatment, severe head injuries can have a poor prognosis. Nevertheless, these patients were never triaged as expectants  and could perhaps have survived in the simulation if they had received a higher priority leading to early transportation by helicopter to a university hospital for neurosurgeryThe result of this study shows that a large part of the Swedish health care system would be involved in this type of event, which might have displacement effects on regular health care in the long term. Furthermore, lessons learned from other burn disasters are that the national specialized intensive care resources can quickly become saturated for a long period. Therefore, the need for additional use of burn beds in Europe would probably arise in the longer term. National planning in case of such needs is called for.In these two simulations, we found that, in rural areas of Sweden, the major challenge in coping with a mass casualty incident with many burn cases is due to the long distances to specialized trauma and burn care units. A significant limitation in these settings is the possibility of achieving rapid patient evacuation based on the accessibility of transport resources (e.g. ambulances and helicopters). During these simulations, the extent of air transportation and coordination of helicopters were shown to be a bottleneck and were identified as significant risk factors for an unfavourable outcome. The absence of predefined organization and coordination routines concerning air transport in a mass casualty event must be addressed further at the national level. Unfortunately, it was not possible to fully test this function during these simulations.The rapid establishment of cooperation between the two county councils where the two national burn centres are located was of importance for the timely response seen in the simulations. This national coordinating function for burn care was established early and in accordance with the proposed national burn response plan. Furthermore, it was operational at an early stage and provided support to the regional management group by developing strategies for the distribution of burns.|The differences in the results between the two simulations were small but detectable and the reproducibility of the simulation was satisfactory. Further experimental simulations are needed with defined interventions to ascertain outcome and examine whether preventable deaths and complications can be reduced. Measurable performance indicators through the ETS, as used in the present study, are obtainable and can depict a more effective management response. The experience from the present simulations using a simulation system that combines both process and outcome indicators can create important results that may serve to support disaster planning. Future studies are needed to further explore how national coordination of air transportation can be optimized for a mass casualty incident in Sweden.||

On this occasion, the development of a strategic concept begun with a proposal made by a commission of experts, and a public debate which transformed the final text into a diplomatic document, not into a true useful document capable of guiding strategic planning over the next decade. These differences between the goals established by the document and the actual resources available to NATO were noted immediately with regard to the crisis management system, for which the organization does not possess the structures and civil means. It is not clear either that this limitation can be solved through cooperation with the EU. The involvement of NATO in the international mission in Libya will be the first test to ascertain the validity and effectiveness of this new strategic concept.

The capacities, organization (High Commands) and military experience that make NATO the most effective organization that has existed in the last half century; 2. A good part of that efficacy is due to the participation of three of the major military powers in the world which, besides, benefit from a combination of conventional and nuclear means; 3. That has given NATO not only an incredible and effective dissuasive ability, but also a proven capacity of power projection at regional and world levels.Weaknesses1. The military hegemony historically held by the United States, which has hindered the development of military capacities of European allies and their political will to assume the roles imposed by regional and world defence, at a time when Washington increasingly shifts its strategic priorities towards the Pacific, not towards the Euro- Atlantic region; 2. The insufficient institutional development of the Alliance's political structure in relation to its military structure, which has continuously incapacitated NATO to take on and adapt to the new world strategic and diplomatic situations; 3. The increasing discrepancy of geo-strategic interests among the allies which, together with the system of decision by consensus, is creating an internal political blockade which will become even more complex with the adherence of new members, such as the Ukraine or Georgia.|||

Description: This article describes an experiential exercise for learning a number of the general core competencies in the 2003 AAMC report titled ""Training Future Physicians about Weapons of Mass Destruction."" A modified tabletop exercise for medical and veterinary students, which was developed and implemented in 2005, is described. The exercise focused on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), an emerging infectious disease scenario that raised the possibility of biological attack. The students were assigned roles in small groups, such as community physicians, hospital personnel, public health officials, veterinarians, school nurses, and emergency managers. Fifteen faculty members were recruited from these various areas of expertise. Pre- and posttesting of medical students showed significant gains in knowledge. The authors describe the scenario, small-group role playing, study questions, injects, Web sites and readings, and evaluation tools. Conclusions: This experiential exercise is an effective, inexpensive, and easily adapted tool for promoting multiple competencies in mass health emergency preparedness for a variety of health care students including medical, veterinary, public health, and nursing students.

The exercise focused on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), an emerging infectious disease scenario that raised the possibility of biological attack. The students were assigned roles in small groups, such as community physicians, hospital personnel, public health officials, veterinarians, school nurses, and emergency managers.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives The hurricane disasters of 2005 and the threat of pandemic infectious diseases compel medical educators to develop emergency preparedness training for medical students and other health care professional students.|The hurricane disasters of 2005 and the threat of pandemic infectious diseases compel medical educators to develop emergency preparedness training for medical students and other health care professional students.The objectives of the exercise:1. The students will gain information about the major concepts of disease reporting, the Incident Command System, and risk communication in an All Hazards approach.2. The participants will practice acting in the role of one stakeholder in a scenario involving a disease epidemic (to gain insight into issues that responders from other professional groups must manage).3. Through interaction with others, the participants will understand the roles of various stakeholders in a disease epidemic.4. The participants will increase in attitudes of willingness to cooperate with other stakeholders to accomplish common goals in a time of hazard.|Not indicated |The exercise was designed for use with multi-professional students: medical, public health, nursing, and veterinary students. The primary target audience was 2nd-year medical students who did not yet have extensive clinical experience.The scenario consisted of one confirmed HPAI fatality of a poultry science student and two other possible, non-confirmed student cases, with no information given about disease in birds. The scenario was deliberately ambiguous about whether the disease was natural or deliberately introduced. In addition to the clinical response, which is the usual focus of training for health professionals, this created the need for involvement of human and animal disease surveillance and disease containment measures, law enforcement investigation, and public information. The scenario was also tailored to the specific characteristics of the Texas A&M University community, which is the “patient” in this outbreak, including its rural setting and correspondingly limited local medical resources.Study questions and “injects” (the technical term for simulated events in an exercise) were developed to guide the students in problem solving and role playing in small groups. Role playing was the means chosen to encourage development of working relationships among health care students. It is one of the educational approaches that has proven effective in multidisciplinary health profession settings and has emerged as a preferred experiential method of learning. The list of recommended pre-readings was developed from written and electronic sources to provide an orientation to emergency management and incident command principles and background information on HPAI. Where possible, these were taken from the Web sites of lead agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to promote familiarity with the sites themselves and with other links from these sitesThe deviation: Because of an administrative misstep, the students did not receive the electronic reading list with embedded hyperlinks, and many of these links were lengthy and hard to enter manually. Thus, they had a much harder task to find the online  readings than was intended.|Table top exercise, per-/post-testing||The first activity of the 3-hr exercise was the administration of a pretest of knowledge and an attitude scale. Then, the first author (RS) presented a brief lecture with slides emphasizing main points from the prereadings. Afterward, the students divided into their assigned role-playing groups and went to separate work areas. Each work area had a computer, a CD of the prereadings and other reference materials, and an Internet connection. Each group selected a speaker. Then the faculty facilitators gave out three to five injects describing how the scenario put demands on their role and questions for discussion. These injects were different from the pr-estudy questions. Usually, injects are given out sequentially by exercise facilitators as the group progresses through problem solving. In this exercise all of the injects for each 45-min session were given out at the beginning of each session because the time constraints were tight.For the second role-playing session, the groups reassembled in combinations. For example, the groups of primary care physicians, the school district, and the county health department were combined. Again, they received three to five injects to guide discussion of how their group roles interrelate in a health emergency, either for mutual information needs or for the potential to pool resources to address common problems. An inject for the team described here was, “How can you work together to manage large numbers of people who want medical screening and reassurance without flooding emergency rooms?” Faculty guidance suggested guiding the group toward disseminating information to families through schools and possibly setting up screening sites at schools. This session also lasted 45 min.Following the small-group sessions, all the students and faculty members reconvened for debriefing. Each role group and each combination of groups presented a summary of their discussions. These sessions addressed Objectives 2 and 3, practicing and understanding the various stakeholder roles.|The exercise had three evaluation processes. First, a criterion referenced written test on the content of the lectures, prereadings, and exercises to measure the extent to which the first objective, understanding key concepts, had been accomplished. The pretest and posttest were identical, and at the debriefing, before the posttest, we went over the answers to the questions. We believed that this would reduce stress and, by multiple repetitions of key points, serve as a tool to teach thepoints we wanted the students to remember. The results of the pretest and posttest were analyzed by paired t tests (two-tailed) using SPSS software.Second, written and verbal comments from the students and facilitators about their experience were requested. The third measure was an attitude scale, whose purpose was to assess changes in student attitudes about working with other professionals and about their roles in a disaster. The analysis of these results revealed that the attitude instrument did not have adequate reliability, and thus we do not have valid data regarding the attainment of Objective 4.||In general, the results confirmed the findings from a previous study that a short, 3-hr interactive exercise is sufficient for improving physicians’ knowledge about bioterrorism preparedness. Many of the students found the exercise fun and eye opening. Some students were clearly frustrated. Unexpected student leaders emerged when faced with a novel set of challenges, including students who supported their classmates by simplifying access to the prereading material and one group that, during the exercise, answered its discussion questions by calling the administrator at the local medical center for real-time information.|Placement of disaster preparedness within the curriculum is important. Curriculum designers and administrators must think carefully about how and where to integrate this new content into existing curriculum.The prereading program was overly ambitious. Prereadings must be carefully selected, prioritized, and made easily accessible to optimize use of participants’ time.The students accurately assessed the weakness of 3 of the 15 facilitators. Few faculty members have deep knowledge of emergency preparedness, a system perspective of their communities, or familiarity with the various response functions.Some of the written comments reflect some students’ expectation that they should be fed information in lectures and told what, out of everything presented, they are required to know for an exam. The exercise was very uncomfortable for these students, as it was deliberately open-ended and required decision making with incomplete information.||

Both the individual trainee and program may be pushed to the limits of physical and mental strain, potentially jeopardizing core competencies of patient care and professionalism. Although daunting, the task of preparing for these events should be a methodical process integrated into every residency training program. Summary: The core elements of emergency preparation with regard to inpatient services include identifying and staffing critical positions, motivating residents to consider the needs of the group over those of the individual, providing for basic needs, and planning activities in order to preserve team morale and facilitate recovery. The authors outline a four-step process in preparing a residency program for an anticipated short-term weather emergency. An example worksheet for emergency planning is included. Conclusion: With adequate preparation, residency training programs can maintain the highest levels of patient care, professionalism, and esprit de corps during weather emergencies. When managed effectively, emergencies may present an opportunity for professional growth and a sense of unity for those involved.

An example worksheet for emergency planning is included (p.170). The article indicates that with adequate reparation, residency training programs can maintain the highest levels of patient care, professionalism, and esprit de corps during weather emergencies. When managed effectively, emergencies may present an opportunity for professional growth and a sense of unity for those involved. In the article, it is explained an internal medicine residency program executed a four-step plan to preserve the highest levels of patient care, professionalism, and esprit de corps.The first three steps: identifying critical resident roles, enlisting residents to staff key positions, and providing for basic needs—should be performed during the preparedness stage of the Comprehensive Emergency management Model. The fourth step: maintenance of morale should span both the response and recovery stages. Even if the lead time to an inclement event is quite short or non existent, execution of an emergency plan can still provide a methodical approach to preparation and management. Given that the duration of many weather emergencies is unpredictable, once it becomes evident that an emergency plan is required, staffing assignments for several days should be planned. Multiple planning worksheets may be required to ensure that the entire crisis is managed systematically.CriteriaDescription (e.g. quote, description, etc.)Experiment, exercise, simulation, or trial objectives No experiment.The authors outline a four-step process in preparing a residency program for an anticipated short-term weather emergency.|No experiment.The authors outline a four-step process in preparing a residency program for an anticipated short-term weather emergency.|||Guide||||| The core elements of emergency preparation with regard to inpatient services include identifying and staffing critical positions, motivating residents to consider the needs of the group over those of the individual, providing for basic needs, and planning activities in order to preserve team morale and facilitate recovery.The authors outline a four-step process in preparing a residency program for an anticipated short-term weather emergency.

A case study of humanitarian disaster management is used to demonstrate the unique abilities of the CDA and Google EarthTM to support situation awareness. The paper provides some of the first empirical evidence on the utility of the virtual globes to support situation awareness for disaster management using implicit geographic information. The evidence presented was derived from evaluations by disaster management practitioners at the United Nations (UN) ReliefWeb project, an extremely relevant, yet difficult group to access for conducting academic disaster management research.

The paper provides some of the first empirical evidence on the utility of the virtual globes to support situation awareness for disaster management using implicit geographic information.|Are virtual globes helpful to develop situation awareness|Software Development:Implicit information processing functions of the CDA are based on the use of geocoding algorithms, automated reasoning procedures, and disaster ontologies to extract geographic and thematic references from web documents referenced from real simple syndication (RSS) feeds. RSS feeds are used as a primary information source as they are an increasingly used format for web content publication and are easy to access computationally due to their XML structur.Upon retrieving an RSS feed, results found by the CDA’s geographic text extraction and geocoding process are rendered in KML and presented in Google Earth using a network link object connected to the CDA information processing server.If an origin point is established, connection line thickness indicates the frequency of place references in a document. The geographic scales of entities found (country, city, county, town etc.) are represented using point symbol shapes. Line and point transparencies indicate how old a document is relative to when the KML was created by the CDA.These visual encoding strategies are used to help disaster managers to remove potentially irrelevant or unneeded information by providing a quick information overview through visual cues.|Tool development and evalutation||-|There is an additional paper about the software evaluation.The evaluation studies were conducted with ReliefWeb. ReliefWeb is a United Nations (UN) funded project managed through the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).CDA-processed documents are listed in the Google Earth legend, the contents and structure of which are determined by the CDA. Legend items contain folders for thematic and geographic references organized by scale (country, state, county, town etc.) found. Information is structured this way by the CDA to provide a disaster manager with interactivity over the display of thematic references and entities by geographic scale. For example, a disaster manager may only want to view counties referenced in documents. Term frequency within a document determines the height a term is rendered in 3D space.The following section provides empirical evidence, derived from a utility study and focus group discussion with disaster management practitioners, of the benefits and drawbacks of the virtual globe capabilities of the CDA to support situation awareness for disaster management.|N/A|Virtual globes can provide the geographic–social context that facilitates geo collaboration—or collaborative processes that are conducted and mediated through geographic information and knowledge.In addition to situation awareness of real world events, participants in any type of group work need to maintain awareness of collaborative activity. Examples of activity awareness include but are not limited to (a) a sense that other collaborators are ‘‘there’’ (social awareness) and (b) what relevant information is known by other collaborators. Activity awareness is important for overall situation awareness as it can influence the activity of collaborators in a given situation.Maps play a critical role as visual mediums to support development of situation awareness in humans. Virtual globes, as a next generation of mapping technology, provide an exciting new direction for supporting situation awareness in disaster management. In particular, virtual globes offer powerful visualization methods, interactivity, geographical context and ease of use that can be utilized for informed decision making tasks critical to effective disaster management. Results of these evaluations indicate the approaches presented offer a promising new direction on the use of virtual globes for situation awareness, disaster management and related research at the intersection of geographic information science and information retrieval. |Future work includes a formal comparison between virtual globe and non-virtual globe (such as a 2D map) environments of the implicit information visualization approach presented in this paper to establish strengths and weakness of both types of approaches. Such a comparison was not possible for the research presented in this paper due to time constraints posed by the limited availability of the UN evaluators whose feedback was deemed critical for evaluating the virtual globe aspects of the approach.A disadvantage of RSS is that a feed’s contents may not be representative of the entirety of a web site’s contents, thus providing only a partial view of available content.

Defining the number of required task force units and locating these task force units within the event area is a critical problem for the commanding decision maker. In this paper, we will first reveal how such decisions are usually made in practice today by reporting the result of interviews with practitioners who were in charge in such situations in Germany. Then we will provide mathematical models and report on computational studies to demonstrate how these decisions can be supported by operations research techniques. Finally, using data from a practical case in the city of Dresden where 50,000 people gathered together, we show that our models can indeed be used to solve real-world problems using commercial software.

Many decision makerssimply use experience instead of systematic procedures. Local authority districts may or may not have guidelines for such cases. The city of Dresden, for instance, which is the location of the practical case described in this article, has one (see Landeshauptstadt Dresden, 2004). It is based on a handbook for task forces where a non-scientific method to calculate the size of the task force is presented. Often, the task forces themselves have defined a set of rules which are applied.|Interview, report and litreture survey, mathematical models|Minimum number of required task force|They collected data through interviews and official reports.|The basic modelling idea is the following: The location of a task force unit can be specified by its grid rectangle. For each feasible location of a task force unit, it can then be specified in advance which grid rectangles can be accessed within a predefined response time from that location being able to take into account constructional barriers, for instance. Mathematically, a binary parameter dpqrs equal to one indicates that grid rectangle (r, s) can be reached from location (p,q) within a certain amount of response time and a value zero indicates that (r, s) cannot be reached from (p,q). Fig. 3 illustrates this idea. Note that for the applicability of the models, it does not matter whether the response time is defined to be the time of the moment of detection of the incident or the time from the moment the alarm call reaches emergency personnel. Depending on the event area, the access area may be very compact (if, for instance, the event area is a meadow, the access area might be a square) or not (if, for instance, the event area is in the inner city, the access area might be along the street network). Both situations can be represented by parameters dpqrs without problems. More mathematical formulas, diagrams and several maps are included in the article, for more information on the visual material please consult the article. |Not indicated|In the case of big events, task force units must be located nearby the event area to ensure safety and help. In this paper, first it was revealed how the number of required task force units is usually determined in Germany. It is realized that very rough estimates are used. Where to locate these task force units best is mainly done by experience of the decision maker. Herewith it was developed mathematical models to give a better decision support in such situations. Basically, three problems were discussed: (1) How many task force units are needed and where to locate them, (2) given a limited number of task force units, where should they be located to cover the event area best to ensure help in a predefined response time, and (3) given a limited number of task force units, where should they be located to cover the event area with a shortest possible response time until help. In addition we discussed the problem of relocating task force units. Although, besides the relocation problem, all these problems are theoretically hard to optimize, computational studies revealed that instances of practical relevance can be solved optimally in short time using standard software. Eventually, we have shown that our approach provides decision support for a real-world case from the city of Dresden where 50000 people gathered together.|Although, besides the relocation problem, all these problems are theoretically hard to optimize, computational studies revealed that instances of practical relevance can be solved optimally in short time using standard software.||

Analytical approach has been based upon development of realistic disaster scenarios and their evaluation with assumption of existence of space-related capabilities available to rescue forces. Building upon analysis''s results, the experimental information environment has been developed and it successfully supported commanding of a large-scale crisis management field training. The results prove that many crisis management needs can be served with existing, commercially available products. The key to success lays in understanding operational needs; integration into common information environment; and standardisation of information exchange.

This has been enhanced by optical images from unmanned aerial vehicle and telemedical systems using GSM network.Case 3: the train transporting hazardous gas crashes with passenger train between stations, in the forest. Satellite navigation system is used to facilitate operations, including exchange of information between different services involved. EO archived images are used to provide information about the neighbourhood of the crash location. Tracking of first units arriving on the scene provides access information for all other forces. EO images present context information about the area.|Comparison of results allows evaluation of actual efficiency of employing space systems into crisis management operations|Not identified|Ability to track all units/groups participating in operation (belonging to different services and structures) and visualise their location on satellite map greatly enhances situational awareness. Ability to access exactly the same data indifferent locations results in a common operational picture for all actors involved both different services and authorities supervising them. Both above-mentioned factors allow for significantly better coordination of common operations. Automatic transmission of status information together with position information may provide for much clearer situational picture. Satellite support team physically present in headquarter is a very effective method to ensure efficient use of available space technologies. Geospatial products (satellite maps and analytical products) should use standardised marking (e.g. NATO standard symbols) to make them easily readable for users. Standards for such products made available electronically are also necessary. Users (commanding officers) require certain time (several hours) to get accustomed to new capabilities, understand them and use effectively. Operational demonstration is a very effective method to validate crisis management systems' concepts and to convince users about their usefulness.|The key to success lays in understanding operational needs; integration into common information environment; and standardisation of information exchange.||

Although the Chinese Government has already carried out a series of emergency education and training programmes to improve public health staff's capability of emergency preparedness, it remains unclear if these training programmes are effective and feasible. The purpose of this research was to evaluate an emergency preparedness training programme and to develop a participatory training approach for emergency response. Methods: Seventy-six public health staff completed the emergency preparedness training programme. The effectiveness of the training was evaluated by questionnaire before training, immediately after training and 12 months after training (follow-up). Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted throughout the training period. Results: The emergency preparedness training improved the knowledge levels and increased attitudinal and behavioural intention scores for emergency preparedness (P<0.01). The results at follow-up showed that the knowledge levels and attitudinal/behavioural intention scores of participants decreased slightly (P>0.05) compared with levels immediately after training (P<0.01). However, there was a significant increase compared with before training (P<0.01). Moreover, more than 80% of participants reported that the training process and resources were scientific and feasible.

As the nation is about to face a tremendous decline in the experienced workforce due to the baby boomer generationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s retirement, it is critical to begin focusing on capturing their knowledge. Cataloging and communicating the knowledge of potential failures is critical to prevent engineering disasters. Many companies have adopted failure-reporting systems that allow them to record their engineering failures to promote failure prevention. While recording this information is vital to learning from past mistakes, often the information is not stored so that engineers and designers can easily recall this valuable linguistic information and use it to improve designs. Therefore, more effective systems for cataloging and utilizing corporate memory of recorded failure events are needed. This article presents the design of a computational linguistic database to support the failure prevention tool, the risk in early design (RED) method. RED promotes failure prevention by identifying failure risks as early as the conceptual phase of product design, where impacts of failure prevention are greatest. It uses a database populated by historical failure event information to present specific areas that are at risk of failure in a product.

The constraints of the decision settings have a strong impact on decision-making. Different decision settings may thus call for different approaches to decision support. The purpose of this paper is to propose a contingency model of decision-making involving risk of accidental loss. Based on two dimensions, (a) proximity to hazard and (b) level of authority, I identify five types of decision settings: (1) operations, (2) business management, (3) administrative and technical support functions, (4) political arenas, and (5) crisis handling. Each setting is characterised in terms of dominant constraints, dominant decision criteria, and representative decision modes. Decision-making is constrained and influenced by previous decisions, and decisions may interact in the way they influence the risk of accidental loss. The following set of concepts may help us identify ways in which safety may be affected by interactions between decisions: (1) distributed decision-making and local optimization, (2) meta-decisions, (3) absorption of uncertainty, and (4) normalization of deviance. Advice for improving decision-making can be derived from the proposed model by identifying possible problems related to each type of decision setting and each pattern of interaction between decisions. The possible problems may be used as a basis for identifying relevant functions of decision aids and to propose specific decision aids. A similar analysis may be performed with regard to the ways in which decisions may interact in their impact on safety.

The environment is characterized by two negotiators, time constraints, deadlines, full information, and the possibility of opting out. The agent can play either role, with communications via a pre-defined language. The model used in constructing the agent is based on a formal analysis of the crises scenario using game-theoretic methods and heuristics for bargaining. The agent receives messages sent by its opponent, analyzes them and responds. It also initiates discussion on one or more parameters of an agreement. Experimental results of simulations of a fishing dispute between Canada and Spain indicate that the agent played at least as well as, and in the case of Spain, significantly better than a human player.

Disaster-preparedness studies tend to focus on formal systems of healthcare and frontline healthcare providers, such as hospital personnel, public health staff, or emergency medical services workers who care for community members having serious injuries. Community members who are not seriously injured, however, are expected to care for themselves immediately after a disaster occurs. To date, little is known about the community members' level of preparedness to meet their basic, self-care needs immediately following a disaster or the effectiveness of such preparedness education for the community. Yet, the health and safety of the general community following a disaster depends on its citizens' level of preparedness to meet the needs not only of the seriously injured, but also of those with minimal or no injuries. Schools of nursing can play a vital role in enhancing the general public's self-care ability following a disaster. The authors of this article describe a clinical learning experience that involved nursing students in a health education project related to one community's desire to better prepare themselves for future disasters. A participatory action research (PAR) approach, which included collaboration with a community, involvement of the target community, and project evaluation, provided a framework for this disaster-preparedness initiative.

Nowadays, strategic plans of counter measures and recovery are developed worldwide. International organizations, non-profit organizations, government institutions and volunteers collaborate in this direction. In these situations, the media is the first to react and to focus on disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes and floods. The second to react is the government and after that the local authorities. Another important aspect to be considered is the impact of the reconstruction process on the environment, the people and the local communities. Training of local population for improving the reaction to possible future disasters is an important issue. This is why this article will make a comparative analysis on how emergency architecture is applied in the disaster management process in different parts of the world.

Drama theory asserts that conflict resolution requires players to engage in a rational-emotional process of re-defining both the game and their Ã¢â‚¬Å“positionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in it until agreement on a satisfactory resolution is reached. While game theory has been widely applied to problems dealing with hazards, risk, and disasters, it assumes fixed players, options, and preferences, and hence does not allow for the re-definition of the conflict under consideration. Results show that drama theory constitutes a flexible and powerful tool for modeling group decision and negotiation processes involving natural, man-made, and health-related hazards, risk, and catastrophes in the post-911 security environment by modeling emotional responses that, throughout the course of a game, can lead to unanticipated reactions and change basic assumptions. This is achieved through the use of option boards to construct and analyze emergency, disaster, or crisis models that are structurally similar to game models. Finally, drama theory is compared and contrasted to conflict analysis, which developed from common roots in metagame analysis. The strengths and weaknesses of drama theory are critically evaluated in the context of global climate change and the mounting risk of a worldwide influenza pandemic.
